I am Professor of Space Environment at the [University of Birmingham](https://birmingham.ac.uk){:target="\_blank"} and am Head of the [Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE)](https://serene.bham.ac.uk){:target="\_blank"} research group.

My research is focused on mitigating the impacts of space weather on technology and society through novel mathematical modelling, exploring fundamental new physics and understanding the engineering solutions. This is my personal website, if you want more information about my research or the University of Birminghamâ€™s SERENE Research Group please visit our dedicated website: [serene.bham.ac.uk](https://serene.bham.ac.uk){:target="\_blank"}

Whilst there may be bits of Space Weather discussion on this site, you're much more likely to find posts about [football](https://seanelvidge.com/articles/tag/football/) (including a [plain text database of all English football league matches](https://seanelvidge.com/articles/2024/All_England_football_league_results/)), [the velocity required to complete a loop the loop](https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2013/loop-the-loop/) or the [number of unique song choices on Desert Island Discs](https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2017/Unique_DID/).

Standalone tools, such as [generating League tables](https://seanelvidge.com/leaguetable) for any given football season, building [recipes for pour-over](https://seanelvidge.com/brewcoffee) coffee brewing or finding the [head-to-head statistics](https://seanelvidge.com/h2h) between football teams can be found on the [tools page](https://seanelvidge.com/tools/).
