Or, in a group what is the likelihood of two people sharing a birthday? The result is quite surprising…</p> <p>Obviously if the group is of size 366 you are guranteed that at least 2 people must share a birthday (for this, and for the rest of the blog I will ignore February 29th Birthdays, sorry if you happen to be born on that day!) but what is very suprising is that you need only 57 people to have 99% chance and 23 for over a 50% chance. The graph for this is below:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Birthday-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Birthday-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Birthday-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/Birthday.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The probability of at least two people in a room sharing a birthday as the number of people in that room grows. </div> <p>Let me show you where this comes from. First, to make life a bit easier for ourselves, I am going to define some assumptions: we ignore leap years, the probability of twins and also assume that you are equally likely to be born on any of the 365 days of the year.</p> <p>Now, define \(P(n)\) to be the probability of at least two people in a group of \(n\) sharing a birthday, and \(P^{'}(n)\) the probability of there not being two people sharing a birthday. Also, since \(P(n)\) and \(P^{'}(n)\) are the only two possibilities and are mutually exclusive we have that:</p> \[P(n)=1-P^{'}(n).\] <p>The easiest way of working this out is to first calculate the probability that all \(n\) birthdays are different. For only 1 person the probability that that 1 person does not share a birthday with someone is \(\frac{365}{365}\).</p> <p>For 2 people, the probability that the second person has a different birthday from person 1 is \(\frac{364}{365}\). The probability that person 3 has a different birthday from 1 and 2 is \(\frac{363}{365}\), and so on and so on. Finally we take note that when events are independent of each other (as they are in this case), the probability of them all occurring is equal to the product of the probabilities.</p> <p>So we can now calculate the probability of there not being two people sharing a birthday (obviously if \(n &gt; 365\) then \(P^{'}(n)=0\), this is by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeonhole_principle">pigeonhole principle</a>). So for \(n \le 365\):</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} P^{'}(n) &amp;=&amp; \frac{365}{365} \times \frac{364}{365} \times \frac{363}{365} \times \frac{362}{365} \times \cdots \times \frac{366-n}{365}, \\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{365 \times 364 \times 363 \times 362 \times \cdots \times (366-n)}{365^n}, \\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{365!}{365^n(365-n)!}. \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in a group of size \(n\) is:</p> \[P(n)=1-\frac{365!}{365^n(365-n)!}.\] <p>And this equation gives you the probablility of two people sharing a birthday in a group of size \(n\). If you want to work the probability out for a different value of \(n\) just plug the value you want into the equation above and run the calculations. It is a suprising result and counter-intuitive, but always a good one to get out at birthday parties…</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="mathematics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What is the probability of two people sharing a birthday]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hilbert’s Hotel</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2010/HilbertHotel/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hilbert’s Hotel"/><published>2010-08-24T22:47:00+00:00</published><updated>2010-08-24T22:47:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2010/HilbertHotel</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2010/HilbertHotel/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> was a greatly influential mathematician born in 1862. He worked in a variety of areas including infinite sets and it is in this area that he presented his ‘Hotel’, or his ‘paradox of the Grand Hotel’. Which helps the reader consider the infinite., so lets give it a go:</p> <p>Consider a hotel with a <em>countably infinite</em> number of rooms. Countably infinite is a set which has the same number of elements (cardinality) of the set of natural numbers (the counting numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, …, there is no fixed decision on whether 0 is a natural number or not, it isn’t important here but I thought I would mention it). Now consider that all of the rooms in the hotel are currently occupied, you may think that the manager should put up a ‘No Vacancy’ sign, but perhaps not…</p> <p>Suppose that a guest turns up looking for a room. What should the manager say? Well that is easy, he gets every guest already in the hotel to move up one room. So the person in room 1 should move to room 2, the person in room 2 moves to room 3 etc. etc. We know this can continue since there is an infinite number of rooms in the hotel. So then we get that room 1 is empty, and we can put the guest in that room. This same method will work for any finite number of guests that show up at the hotel!</p> <p>Now how about if countably infinite number of people turn up asking for a room in the hotel. Can we fit infinitely more people into the hotel? Once again the manager has no problems, he asks the guests to move rooms. He asks the person in room 1 to move to room 2, the person in room 2 to room 4, the person in room 3 to room 6 and in general the person in room \(n\) to \(2n\). Again we can do this because there is an infinite number of rooms in the hotel! Now \(2n\) is always even, so all the odd numbered rooms are free, and the number of odd numbers is the same as the number of natural numbers, so there are countably infinite spaces. The fact that the odd numbers and natural numbers have the same cardinality itself is counter-intuitive, but hopefully I can convince you that it is true very quickly:</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} 1 &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; 1 \\ 3 &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; 2 \\ 5 &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; 3 \\ 7 &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; 4 \\ 9 &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; 5 \\ 11 &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; 6 \\ \vdots &amp;\longrightarrow &amp; \vdots \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So there is a clear mapping between the natural numbers and the odd numbers. Hence the infinite number of guests can fit in the hotel.</p> <p>The final case to consider, what if a countably infinite number of coaches turn up, each with a countably infinite number of passengers. Is there room for all of them in the hotel? You’ve guessed it, there is! As long as the seats on the coaches are numbered (we can avoid this condition if we can use the beast which is the ‘<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_choice">Axiom of Choice</a>’) we can find everyone a room. First we want to empty all of the odd rooms again, we do this the same as above, move everyone in room \(n\) to room \(2n\). Now take the 1st coach, say the seats are numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots\) then we can place the person in coach 1, seat 1 in room \(3^1\), seat 2 in room \(3^2\), seat 3 in room \(3^3\) etc. etc. Now for coach 2, again with seats numbered \(1, 2, 3, \ldots\) we place the person in seat 1 in room \(5^1\), seat 2 to room \(5^2\) etc. etc. So in general for coach \(i\) and the person in seat \(n\) we can place them in room \(p^n\) where \(p\) is \(i+1\)th prime number, and there we have it! We have taken our hotel, with a countably infinite number of rooms, each of which is occupied, and managed to find space for an infinite number of coaches, each with an infinite number of passengers.</p> <p>This is a great concept to test your understanding of infinity. The reason that this all works is because in a hotel with infinitely many rooms the statements ‘every room is occupied’ and ‘no more guests can stay in the hotel’ are not the same.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="mathematics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Use Hilbert's hotel to rethink about infinity]]></summary></entry></feed>
