Modern players are scoring at unprecedented rates, and while this is undoubtedly exciting for fans, it raises an important question: Are today’s goal-scoring feats truly comparable to those of past legends?</p> <p>The landscape of international football has evolved significantly. The expansion of FIFA membership has introduced many new, smaller nations into the competitive arena. This influx has led to more matches where traditional football powerhouses face off against developing teams, often resulting in lopsided scorelines. Consequently, contemporary players have more opportunities to inflate their goal tallies against weaker opposition.</p> <p>This shift poses a challenge when attempting to compare the goal-scoring records of current players with those from previous eras. The legends of the past often played fewer matches against a more consistent level of competition, making their goal tallies a reflection of performances against relatively equal opponents.</p> <p>So, how can we level the playing field and make fair comparisons across different football eras?</p> <h2 id="introducing-a-weighted-goal-system">Introducing a Weighted Goal System</h2> <p>To address this disparity, I embarked on a project to adjust goal records by accounting for the relative strength of the opposition. The idea is to assign a weighting to each goal based on the difficulty of scoring against a particular team at the time of the match. This method aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of a player’s goal-scoring achievements.</p> <h3 id="utilizing-elo-ratings">Utilizing Elo Ratings</h3> <p>The foundation of this approach lies in the Elo rating system, a method originally devised for ranking chess players but now widely adopted across various sports, including football. Elo ratings provide a dynamic measure of a team’s strength, updating after each match based on the result and the quality of the opposition.</p> <p>By leveraging historical Elo ratings, we can assess the relative strength of any two teams at the time they played. This allows us to calculate a weighting factor for each goal scored, reflecting the challenge posed by the opponent.</p> <h3 id="the-weighting-formula">The Weighting Formula</h3> <p>The weighting for each goal is determined using the following formula:</p> \[\text{Weight} = 1 - k\times\frac{E-O}{E}\] <p>Where, \(E\) is the Elo rating of England before the match, \(O\) is the Elo rating of the opposition before the match and \(k\) a scaling constant that adjusts the sensitivity of the weighting to the difference in Elo ratings.</p> <p>This formula adjusts the weight of a goal based on how much stronger or weaker the opposition is relative to England:</p> <ul> <li>If England faces a stronger team (\(O &gt; E\)), the weighting increases above 1, acknowledging the greater difficulty.</li> <li>If England faces a weaker team (\(O &lt; E\)), the weighting decreases below 1, reflecting the relatively easier challenge.</li> <li>The constant \(k\) controls how much the difference in ratings affects the weighting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="interpreting-the-weighting">Interpreting the Weighting</h3> <p>Adjusting the \(k\) value alters the impact of the opposition’s strength:</p> <ul> <li>A higher \(k\) value (e.g., 2) amplifies the effect, giving more weight to goals against stronger teams and less to those against weaker ones.</li> <li>A lower \(k\) value (e.g., 1) minimizes the effect, resulting in a more uniform weighting across different opponents.</li> </ul> <p>By experimenting with different \(k\) values, we can fine-tune the system to balance fairness and sensitivity, ensuring that exceptional performances against top-tier teams are appropriately recognized while maintaining a reasonable value for consistent scoring against all opponents.</p> <p>For the rest of this post we use a value of \(k=2\).</p> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>When I last wrote a post similar to this, Wayne Rooney had just <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2015/Rooney-50/">broke the England National team goal record with 50 goals</a>. Since then Kane has broke this record again (at the time of writing) with 69 goals. Using the above approach the updated top 10 of England goal scorers are (the “Ranking” is based on the weighted goals column):</p> <style>table{border-collapse:collapse;width:50%;margin:20px auto}th,td{border:1px solid black;padding:8px;text-align:left}th{cursor:pointer;background-color:#f4f4f4}</style> <table id="footballTable"> <thead> <tr> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 0)">Ranking</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 1)">Name</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 2)">Goals</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 3)">Weighted Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Harry Kane</td> <td>69</td> <td>45</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Gary Lineker</td> <td>48</td> <td>37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Bobby Charlton</td> <td>49</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Jimmy Greaves</td> <td>44</td> <td>35</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Wayne Rooney</td> <td>53</td> <td>34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Michael Owen</td> <td>40</td> <td>30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Alan Shearer</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Tom Finney</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Nat Lofthouse</td> <td>30</td> <td>22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Frank Lampard</td> <td>29</td> <td>21</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <script>function sortTable(e,r){const s=document.getElementById(e),t=Array.from(s.rows).slice(1),n=!isNaN(t[0].cells[r].innerText);let o=t.sort((e,s)=>{return(n?+e.cells[r].innerText:e.cells[r].innerText.toLowerCase())>(n?+s.cells[r].innerText:s.cells[r].innerText.toLowerCase())?1:-1});const c="asc"===s.dataset.sortOrder?"desc":"asc";"desc"===c&&o.reverse(),s.dataset.sortOrder=c,o.forEach(e=>s.tBodies[0].appendChild(e))}</script> <p>You can see that whilst Kane is still number 1 - his number of goals are significantly less. (Note that the adjusted number of goals here have been rounded to the nearest goal for ease of reading).</p> <p>As may be expected Kane has the biggest change between actual goals scored (69) and the weighted number of goals (45) with a difference of 24, perphaps reaffirming the theory that modern day players are scoring a significant amount of their goals against weaker opposition than in the past. Gary Lineker moves from 4th in the all time list to 2nd.</p> <p>At the other end of the table we end up with a number of people (41) who (because of the rounding as well) move from having scored at least 1 for England to being on 0 goals, but only four who go from more than 1 to zero:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black;

xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Solar_storms_are_like_buses/"><![CDATA[<p>This was the second time this year they have been broadly visible across the UK, with the last major display occurring on the evening of May 10th, 2024. For many, seeing these incredible lights twice in a single year is almost unheard of, and for good reason: before 2024, the UK hadn’t experienced a space weather event of these magnitudes, in over two decades.</p> <p>What has caused this sudden surge in activity? The answer lies in the Sun’s solar cycle, which is rapidly approaching the peak of its activity, and, just like waiting for a bus, after 20 years of relative calm, the UK has now seen two major solar storms in the space of six months.</p> <h2 id="solar-maximum-the-driver-behind-the-lights">Solar Maximum: The Driver Behind the Lights</h2> <p>At the heart of this increased auroral activity is the Sun itself. The Sun goes through cycles of roughly 11 years, moving from periods of quiet (solar minimum) to periods of high activity (solar maximum). We’re currently approaching solar maximum, and this is why we’re seeing more frequent and powerful solar storms.</p> <p>These storms occur when the Sun releases huge quantities matter and magnetic field in the form of a coronal mass ejection (CME) which are also very often associated with solar flares. When these high-speed and high-energy CMEs reach Earth, they can interact and disturb our planet’s magnetic field, causing the stunning lights of the aurora. During solar maximum, the Sun produces more of these storms, leading to auroras that are brighter, more widespread, and visible at lower latitudes—like the UK.</p> <h2 id="what-makes-these-storms-so-special">What Makes These Storms So Special?</h2> <p>Solar storms are typically classified according to the NOAA Space Weather Scale which, for geomagnetic storms, run from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme), whilst the storm back in May was classified as a G5 (extreme) storm last night the storm peaked at a G4 (severe) event. For context, the last time the UK saw storms of this ‘size’ was over 20 years ago, in October 2003.</p> <p>What makes these storms particularly fascinating is that they push the auroral oval, the region around the poles where the Northern Lights occur, further south. Normally, the UK is too far from the poles to regularly see auroras, but during a G4 or G5 storm, the lights can be visible much further south than the usually are.</p> <h2 id="the-smartphone-effect">The Smartphone Effect</h2> <p>However this was still a relatively mild storm, and can be expected to occur on average about once every 3 or 4 years. One thing that has been particularly different this time around (for both last night and the storm in May), however, is the number of pictures flooding social media. Thanks to the widespread use of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras, capturing the aurora has never been easier. Modern smartphones now have the ability to take long-exposure shots, which allows them to capture the faint light of the aurora in ways the naked eye cannot. As a result, these natural light shows are being documented and shared like never before, over the coming months and year it may make it feel as if the auroras are more frequent than they might have seemed during previous solar cycles.</p> <h2 id="serene-understanding-space-weather">SERENE: Understanding Space Weather</h2> <p>While the visual spectacle of an aurora is captivating, there’s serious science behind these storms. The Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) group at the University of Birmingham is at the forefront of research into space weather and its effects on Earth. As a world-class research team, SERENE focuses on understanding the impacts of solar storms and helping society prepare for the disruptions they can cause.</p> <p>Space weather doesn’t just create auroras; it can also affect critical systems such as communications, GPS, satellite orbits and even the power grid. SERENE’s work is vital for mitigating the risks posed by these powerful geomagnetic storms. Their research is ensuring that as we enjoy the beauty of the Northern Lights, we’re also better equipped to protect the technology that supports modern life.</p> <h2 id="looking-ahead-more-auroras-to-come">Looking Ahead: More Auroras to Come?</h2> <p>As we approach the peak of the solar cycle, we can expect more opportunities to witness auroras in the UK. Solar storms will continue to erupt from the Sun and head toward Earth, and if the conditions are right (including cloud-free skies!), we could see even more stunning displays over the next couple of years. For those eager to catch the lights, staying tuned to space weather forecasts during this period of increased activity is key.</p> <p>The next time you see those vibrant reds and greens shimmering in the night sky, you’ll know that it’s not just a stroke of luck - it’s the Sun, cycling through its periodic bursts of activity. And thanks to research groups like SERENE, we can enjoy the beauty of the aurora with the peace of mind that we’re ready for whatever space weather may bring.</p> <p>Originally available from: <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2024/solar-storms-are-like-buses-you-wait-20-years-for-one-and-then-two-come-at-once" target="\_blank">https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2024/solar-storms-are-like-buses-you-wait-20-years-for-one-and-then-two-come-at-once</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, across much of the world including the UK, the majestic aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, were once again visible to us.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The M69 Derby</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/The_M69_Derby/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The M69 Derby"/><published>2024-09-21T06:44:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-21T06:44:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/The_M69_Derby</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/The_M69_Derby/"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I watched Coventry City FC vs Leicester City FC in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M69_derby" target="\_blank">“M69” derby (formerly the “A46” derby)</a>. It was a great game, but I’ve always found the name a bit odd, but then it isn’t the only football match referred to by a road name, but there seems to be no consistent reason why we do or do not.</p> <p>Since the naming of these derbys is essentially arbitrary I’ve decided that a match between two teams is the “something” derby if more than half the journey (by road) between the two teams stadia is on one road.</p> <p>For all English Premier League, Championship, League 1, League 2 and Scottish Premier League teams that results in the following matrix of derby names</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/derbys-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/derbys-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/derbys-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/derbys.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Which gives rise to a lot of potential derby’s, most of which would be called the “M1” or “M6” derby. To narrow it down, only unique road matches will be called derby’s (e.g. the only appearance of the M69 in the table is between Cov and Leicester; green in the previous image).</p> <ul> <li>The A19 Derby: Newcastle United v Middlesbrough</li> <li>The A23 Derby: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Crawley Town</li> <li>The A4040 Derby: Aston Villa v West Bromwich Albion</li> <li>The A59 Derby: Harrogate Town v Accrington Stanley</li> <li>The A6010 Derby: Manchester City v Salford City</li> <li>The A630 Derby: Sheffield United v Rotherham United</li> <li>The A66 Derby: Middlesbrough v Carlisle United</li> <li>The M23 Derby: Crystal Palace v Crawley Town</li> <li>The M27 Derby: Southampton v Portsmouth</li> <li>The M55 Derby: Blackpool v Preston North End</li> <li>The M69 Derby: Coventry City v Leicester City</li> </ul> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tees%E2%80%93Wear_derby">Tees–Wear derby</a> between Middlesbrough and Sunderland has been called the A19 derby, but our research shows it would be better for Newcastle v Middlesborough.

Two excellent wikis exist to document the vast Star Trek universe, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Main" target="\_blank">Memory Alpha</a> (using information from all released television series and feature films) and <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="\_blank">Memory Beta</a> (using information from all TV, films and licensed Star Trek works, including novels, comic books, RPG sourcebooks, video games and any other licensed works).</p> <p>In the “primary” canon, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank">52 of the 289 rules were defined</a> and in the extended canon <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi_Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank">144 of the 285 rules were defined</a> (although Rule #2 is defined twice, in different ways).</p> <p>In September 2024 OpenAI released their <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="\_blank">“o1-preview” model</a> which were “trained to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes”. It seems like a very powerful model so I decided to put it to the test…</p> <p>I feed it the complete biographical information of the Ferengi’s, their biology, psychology (greed and self preservation), societal information and culture (profit and loss, beliefs, rituals and diplomacy) which are well defined, and referenced <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi" target="\_blank">here</a>. Along with that I provided the 144 existing rules from the wider canon and asked it to fill in the missing rules.</p> <p>And what a wonderful job it did! The complete list is below, merging the ChatGPT-derived rules along with the existing canon (with those by ChatGPT clearly highlighted) but some of my favourites it came up with are:</p> <p>#12 “Anything worth doing is worth doing for profit.”</p> <p>#24: “Never mix business with pleasure unless it enhances profit.”</p> <p>#28: “Morality is always negotiable in the pursuit of profit.”</p> <p>#80: “If it works, sell it; if it doesn’t, sell it as an antique.”</p> <p>#96: “For every opportunity, there’s an equal and opposite opportunity—exploit both.”</p> <p>#114: “The small print holds the biggest profits.”</p> <p>#132: “A lie isn’t a lie until someone else knows the truth.”</p> <p>#161: “Never work for free, unless there’s future profit.”</p> <h2 id="complete-list-of-the-rules-of-acquisition">Complete List of the Rules of Acquisition</h2> <p>Note: if the source is not ChatGPT then these rules come from the <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi_Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank">Ferengi Rules of Acquisition by Memory Beta</a>, which contains more details including links to the source material/epsiode guide.</p> <table border="1" class="dataframe"> <thead> <tr style="text-align: left;"> <th>Rule Number</th> <th>Rule</th> <th>Source</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Once you have their money... you never give it back.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Nagus", PRD episode: "First Con-tact"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Money is everything.</td> <td>ST - Strange New Worlds 9 short story: "The Last Tree on Ferenginar: A Ferengi Fable From the Future"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Maquis, Part II"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Sedition and treason are always profitable.</td> <td>ST video game: Star Trek Online</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Always exaggerate your estimates.</td> <td>SCE eBook: Cold Fusion</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Never allow family law stand in the way of opportunity.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Nagus"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Keep your ears open.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "In the Hands of the Prophets"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Small print leads to large risk.</td> <td>DS9 reference: The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Opportunity plus instinct equals profit.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Storyteller"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Greed is eternal.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Prophet Motive"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>Opportunity waits for no one—seize it quickly.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12</td> <td>Anything worth doing is worth doing for profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13</td> <td>Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>14</td> <td>Sometimes the quickest way to find profits is to let them find you.</td> <td>Fortune of War (TTN novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15</td> <td>Dead men close no deals.</td> <td>Demons of Air and Darkness (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>A deal is a deal... until a better one comes along.</td> <td>The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition (DS9 reference book)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17</td> <td>A contract is a contract is a contract... but only between Ferengi</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Body Parts"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>18</td> <td>A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Heart of Stone", DS9 - The Dog of War comic: "Issue 3"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>19</td> <td>Satisfaction is not guaranteed.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>He who dives under the table today lives to profit tomorrow.</td> <td>Ferenginar: Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed (DS9 novella)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21</td> <td>Never place friendship above profit.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Rules of Acquisition", PRD episode: "First Con-tact"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>22</td> <td>A wise man can hear profit in the wind.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Rules of Acquisition"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23</td> <td>Nothing is more important than your health... except for your money.</td> <td>ENT episode: "Acquisition"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24</td> <td>Never mix business with pleasure unless it enhances profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>25</td> <td>There's no profit in altruism.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>26</td> <td>Customers are like latinum; treasure them and they'll return.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>27</td> <td>There's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>28</td> <td>Morality is always negotiable in the pursuit of profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29</td> <td>What's in it for me?</td> <td>Highest Score (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30</td> <td>"Confidentiality equals profit."</td> <td>DS9 - The Badlands novel: Part IV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>31</td> <td>Never make fun of a Ferengi's mother.

The product of a large solar storm, curtains of green, red and purple light rippled across the night sky in regions where the spectacle is seldom seen. I saw them for the first time in the United Kingdom, from my back garden just outside Birmingham. More displays are expected in the coming months as solar activity starts to reach its peak.</p> <p>But what most people didn’t see were the repercussions — and the preparations that went on behind the scenes to mitigate them. Radio communications systems experienced blackouts; Starlink, the satellite Internet provider, faced outages; and disruptions to global navigation satellite systems caused problems for sectors reliant on positioning. Meanwhile, flights were re-routed and electric grids were safeguarded.</p> <p>This illustrates a dilemma faced by space-weather scientists such as myself: how can we issue and communicate effective warnings when even such a significant storm changes little in most people’s lives? I think part of the problem lies in how we classify space weather. Current systems are simplistic; space weather is not.</p> <p>Geomagnetic storms are classified using scales developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in collaboration with the space-weather community. The geomagnetic storm scale (G-scale), solar radiation storm scale (S-scale) and radio blackout scale (R-scale) range from one to five, with five denoting an extreme event.</p> <p>These scales have been invaluable in highlighting the risk of space weather to industries and governments, but they are due a refresh. The geomagnetic storm that caused the May auroras was classified as G5, or ‘extreme’. However, the effects of a solar storm are challenging to quantify. This storm was triggered by a rapid sequence of at least seven coronal mass ejections — massive bursts of solar matter and magnetic fields expelled from the surface of the Sun. As these collided with Earth’s magnetic field, they compressed and disturbed it, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00007-1" target="\_blank">triggering geomagnetic storms</a>.</p> <p>But many factors, including the speed, mass, duration and magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections, influence a storm’s impact. In terms of peak geomagnetic activity, the May storm was a 1-in-10-year event. What set this storm apart was its prolonged duration. Geomagnetic disturbances remained high for 24 hours, making it more like a 1-in-75-year event. Auroras were visible for longer, allowing more people to witness them.</p> <p>Such details make it hard to convey the risks of space weather without overstating or understating them. If an event such as that seen in May, deemed ‘extreme’, results in minimal obvious disruption, how should the risks of an even stronger 1-in-100-year storm be conveyed?</p> <p>A superstorm is a looming reality. Costs could reach billions of dollars. Electric grids could be disrupted, causing local blackouts. Satellites, and the essential systems they support, could be impaired. Radio signals, crucial for aviation, maritime operations and emergency services, would be disrupted. For example, in October 2003, geomagnetic storms affected satellite communications, GPS systems and power supplies in Europe, North America and Africa.</p> <p>To communicate the severity of truly extreme storms, scientists need to rethink the classification scales. Some researchers suggest extending severity levels to six and above. Others propose covering more phenomena, including the D-Scale (radiation dose rate) and the T-Scale (radio-wave propagation through Earth’s upper atmosphere).</p> <p>My preferred approach is to shift to a ‘traffic light’ model of warnings for specific sectors. For example, yellow space-weather warnings could alert industries, such as aviation and agriculture, that might be affected by minor geomagnetic storms. An orange warning might require users, such as power grid and radar operators, to consider taking pre-emptive action to protect their services and prepare for interruptions. A red warning would signal that dangerous space weather is expected, with potentially significant impacts requiring immediate action, and power companies, satellite operators and emergency services must implement contingency plans without delay.</p> <p>Such a system would quickly alert those who should be most concerned. It could accommodate uncertainties by allowing for updates and escalations in warnings as data become available. For example, a geomagnetic event might start with a yellow warning (high impact, but unlikely) when a coronal mass ejection is first observed. It could be upgraded to orange or red if the probability of disruption increases with further modelling and data. Its reach could easily be expanded by adding sectors to the warning list.</p> <p>A unified approach to refining space weather reporting and response strategies is crucial, and space weather centres worldwide must come together to discuss and agree on an updated approach. They must ensure that terms such as ‘extreme’ are not misused and that these align with events that truly warrant attention and action, and that industries and the public are adequately prepared for the real risks.</p> <p>As we navigate the peak of the solar cycle, it is important to acknowledge that space weather affects our daily lives. By refining classification and reporting systems, scientists can better align public perception with reality, ensuring that we are neither crying wolf nor caught unprepared.</p> <p>Nature 630, 271 (2024)</p> <p>doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01715-z" target="\_blank">https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01715-z</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Categorizing geomagnetic storms on a scale of one to five leaves no room for once-a-century superstorms]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Trends for Solar Flares</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Google_trends_for_solar_fares/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Trends for Solar Flares"/><published>2024-06-04T16:35:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-06-04T16:35:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Google_trends_for_solar_fares</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Google_trends_for_solar_fares/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a> shows the popularity of search queries in Google Search across various regions and languages.

They occur when the Moon’s orbit aligns perfectly to cast a shadow over the Earth, temporarily blocking the Sun’s light. Beyond their awe-inspiring visual display, these events provide scientists with a natural laboratory to study phenomena otherwise hidden in the light of day.</p> <p>This year, <a href="https://serene.bham.ac.uk/group/people/david-themens/" target="\_blank">David Themens</a> and <a href="https://serene.bham.ac.uk/group/people/ben-reid/">Ben Reid</a> from the <a href="https://serene.bham.ac.uk/" target="\_blank">Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE)</a> research group at the University of Birmingham are undertaking an ambitious scientific experiment during the total solar eclipse on April 8th, 2024. Stationed in Fredericton, Canada, they are investigating the eclipse’s impacts on the ionosphere – a layer of Earth’s upper atmosphere filled with charged particles, known as plasma, that plays a crucial role in radio communication.</p> <p>Joining forces with the <a href="https://www.unb.ca/" target="\_blank">University of New Brunswick’s</a> EclipseNB mission, Themens and Reid will utilise an advanced network of newly developed sounding instruments and observatories spanning the Canadian path of totality. This initiative builds on the curiosity sparked by observations during the “Great American Eclipse” of August 21, 2017, propelling forward our understanding of the ionosphere’s dynamics.</p> <blockquote> <p>The insights gained from this experiment have the potential to improve our understanding of the ionosphere’s response to solar eclipses<br/> Dr David Themens, Space Environment and Radio Engineering Group (SERENE)</p> </blockquote> <p>Central to their research is the Assimilation Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Model (A-CHAIM), an innovative space weather model that Themens and Reid have developed. By integrating data from a constellation of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observatories and other sensors, A-CHAIM will offer unprecedented insights into the ionosphere’s behaviour under the shadow of the eclipse.</p> <p>This analysis is not merely academic; the ionosphere’s plasma can significantly interfere with GNSS signals, such as those from GPS, leading to navigation errors. Understanding and modelling the eclipse’s effects on these systems is vital for improving the reliability of communication and navigation technologies that underpin modern society.</p> <p>The insights gained from this experiment have the potential to improve our understanding of the ionosphere’s response to solar eclipses. By tracking the formation of plasma instabilities and assessing their impact on GNSS signal integrity, Themens and Reid’s work will enhance our ability to predict and mitigate these effects in the future.</p> <p>Moreover, this research will test the limits of A-CHAIM, and other ionospheric models developed by SERENE, predictive capabilities, with the hope of refining these critical tool for global users.

The Lights are a beautiful sight, and photos of them have appeared throughout the media – there was even a live ‘Can you spot the Northern Lights across the UK?’ page on the BBC website running until 2am. As majestic as they are, they also serve as a reminder of the considerable impact that our Sun can play on modern technological systems.</p> <p>Sitting at the centre of the Solar System is the Sun, a giant ball of ionized plasma - a state of matter made up of positively and negatively charged particles. Some of this plasma is constantly streaming out into space, which we call the solar wind.</p> <p>Thankfully the Earth has a Star Trek-esque shield, the magnetosphere, protecting our atmosphere from being blown away. However some of the high-energy electrons in the solar wind make it through the shield and can hit molecules in our atmosphere. During these collisions some of the electrons energy is transferred to the molecules and, if the conditions are just right, cause them to vibrate and emit a tiny amount of light. The colour of this light depends on the amount of energy involved and the altitude of the interaction. Enough vibrating molecules, enough emitted light and voilà, we get the aurorae (Borealis or Australis), which typically form in the high latitudes above 65 degrees north or south, but this can vary significantly.</p> <p>‘Space Weather’ is a term which describes variations in the near-Earth space environment and the influence that has on technology and human life and health. Just like terrestrial weather, space weather is impacted by storms. Minor storms, like we have experienced this week, are relatively common, a major storm may occur once or twice per decade and solar ‘superstorms’ occur once every 100 to 200 years. During these storms the aurora can be seen at lower latitudes which is why they have been visible over the UK recently. In the most severe storms, famously during the “Carrington Event” in 1859, the aurora were observed in the Caribbean and Hawaiian Islands! But the aurora are not the only consequence of space weather.</p> <p>Aside from pictures of the aurora, space weather does not feature in the everyday news and goes largely unrecognised by the public. However, space weather must be accommodated in the design and operation of an increasing number of modern technological systems. For example, high energy particles associated with space weather can cause satellite failures and can render satellite-based navigation systems, such as GPS - a now ubiquitous technology - useless for several days. Other impacts are experienced on the electricity grid, satellite and cellular communications systems, avionics and the radiation doses experienced by air passengers and crew. Even communications with aeroplanes are impacted, and can be completely disrupted, forcing airlines to change their routes and rely on backup systems. Looking to the future, space weather will be a major hazard on any crewed mission to Mars.</p> <p>The impact of space weather on all these systems will be much more significant during a solar superstorm with serious consequences for the national infrastructure, UK industry and the wider public. As a result, in 2011 space weather was added to the Government National Risk Register of Civil Emergencies, with its likelihood currently judged as comparable to that of an emerging infectious disease. Only by providing sufficient advance warning and having robust plans in place for reacting to an extreme event, can we be confident of minimising the consequences.</p> <p>The Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) research group at the University of Birmingham investigate innovative mathematical methods, and develop novel small scale, and non-linear physics, to create the next generation of space weather forecast models. These models can be used to provide accurate, and actionable, forecasts to improve airline route planning to avoid communications losses, predict outages of GPS, warn satellite operators of potential collisions, and even tell you when and where you are most likely going to be able to take your own photo of the aurora.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[People across the UK have been mesmerised by the Northern Lights, but majestic as they are, the Lights remind us of our vulnerability to space weather.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Should You Really Worry About Solar Flares (Scientific American)</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Should_you_worry_about_solar_flares/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Should You Really Worry About Solar Flares (Scientific American)"/><published>2023-01-26T14:31:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-26T14:31:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Should_you_worry_about_solar_flares</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Should_you_worry_about_solar_flares/"><![CDATA[<p>On January 6 a powerful solar flare erupted from the surface of the sun. It was the first X-class flare—the strongest type on the flare intensity scale—<a href="https://twitter.com/erikapal/status/1613251397516132352">in around two months</a>. Two further X-class flares followed within the next few days, marking a distinct uptick in solar activity—and in breathless speculations that the flurry of flares could threaten us here on Earth. One U.K. tabloid <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/world-news/earth-facing-massive-solar-storm-28913925">raised the possibility</a> of “major continent-wide power blackouts.” “Terrifying solar storm coming to Earth,” <a href="https://tech.hindustantimes.com/tech/news/terrifying-solar-storm-coming-to-earth-sunspot-set-to-spark-x-class-solar-flare-explosion-today-71673507979553.html">read another outlet’s headline</a>.</p> <p>Heliophysicists and other scientists studying “space weather” warn that flares and related solar outbursts can indeed interfere with modern life by damaging power grids, as well as by increasing radiation exposures for occupants of space habitats and high-altitude aircraft. But even so, such experts say, the risk of harm arising from inclement space weather remains far lower than many media reports often suggest. Does that mean we shouldn’t worry any time our star decides to belch in our general direction? Not exactly. Knowing what to worry about and when, however, requires proper context and perspective.</p> <p>Solar flares arise within the sun’s roiling soup of plasma when charged particles thrash around one another to form intense magnetic field lines that can tangle and interweave. When these magnetic fields suddenly shift or realign—as often happens in sunspot-pocked “active regions” of the solar surface—an enormous amount of energy is released.</p> <p>There is no question that these solar eruptions, and particularly X-class flares, are mind-bogglingly powerful. One of the strongest solar flares ever seen, the Carrington Event of 1859, may have released as much energy as <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1917356116">10 billion megatons of exploding TNT</a>. Imagine the infamous Tsar Bomba—the most powerful thermonuclear weapon ever detonated—and you’re about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba#:~:text=50%E2%80%9358%20megatons%20of%20TNT">five billionths</a> of the way there.</p> <p>Most solar eruptions are nowhere near this energetic. But they can still propel enormous, planet-engulfing clouds of plasma called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) toward Earth, as well as anywhere else in the solar system. Direct hits on our world by CMEs can and do occur, and each event packs more than enough oomph to discernibly disrupt some modern electronics. Even so, such disruptions are usually subtle and have little to no impact on most peoples’ daily lives.</p> <h2 id="another-day-another-flare">Another Day, Another Flare</h2> <p>In aggregate, spates of space-weather scaremongering are easy to predict because they’re usually tied to solar activity itself, which follows a roughly 11-year cycle. Each round of the cycle sees our star oscillate once between two main states: the solar minimum, in which flare activity tends to be at its lowest, and the solar maximum, in which flare activity tends to be strongest. <a href="https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products/solar-cycle-progression">Currently</a>, the sun is slightly more than two years away from its maximum, so heightened activity (and media alertness) is to be expected now and for the next few years.</p> <p>“At this point, I do not need to convince you that we are not facing the apocalypse,” says Erika Palmerio, a heliophysicist at solar research company Predictive Science. “The point is that solar activity is rising at the moment because that is what is expected of the solar cycle.” X-class flares, for instance, are quite common during periods of heightened solar activity despite their ominous “strongest” ranking. According to Palmerio, a typical solar cycle produces almost 200 of them, with most occurring towards the maximum. Statistically speaking, that implies we can expect more than a dozen X-class flares to erupt this year alone.</p> <p>When the next one happens, it’s important to remember a key caveat often overlooked in subsequent media coverage: While X-class events occupy the highest tier of flare intensity, this tier has no upper limit. So despite all X-class flares residing in the “strongest” category, they still can vary enormously in strength. The Carrington Event, for example, would by some estimates have registered as an X40 flare, whereas the flares at the start of this month all ranked at far more humdrum levels of between X1 and X2.</p> <h2 id="the-realistic-threats">The Realistic Threats</h2> <p>Simply put, even the most severe solar outbursts in living memory have had relatively subdued effects.</p> <p>This is partly because, despite the alarming but unlikely possibility of widespread electricity blackouts, space weather does not tend to affect phones, laptops and other everyday electronic devices at all. “I can’t think of any consumer electronic impacts that would even be possible,” says Sean Elvidge, head of space environment research at the University of Birmingham in England. CMEs can and do pose threats to power grids by interacting with Earth’s magnetic field and inducing excess electrical currents along and through the planet’s surface that sometimes last for hours. Given sufficiently mighty currents from a strong solar storm, unprotected transformers along power grids can be severely damaged and knocked offline, which reduces a grid’s capacity and necessitates time-consuming and expensive repair and replacement work.</p> <p>“But this really can only happen in very long cables or pipelines,” Elvidge adds. “So we don’t see that in your house. Your house just isn’t a problem for that kind of thing.”</p> <p>Palmerio says there is one highly unlikely way in which an electronic device might be affected by a solar storm: If it were to be struck by a single, very strongly charged solar particle that transfers most of its energy to the device upon impact. Scientists refer to such incidents as a single-event upset. “So you’re at your computer, and this one extremely strong particle hits your computer and fries it,” Palmerio says. “But obviously, the probabilities are very low. It’s definitely not something on the order of ‘all the mobile phones in this entire country are fried.’ That’s not going to happen.”</p> <p>Such events do become more likely at higher latitudes because of the tendency for a solar storm’s swarms of charged particles to accumulate around Earth’s poles, where the planet’s magnetic field is strongest. They become more likely at higher altitudes as well, where the thinner atmosphere offers less protection against incoming particles. Such diminished protections are also why jet travel increases one’s total radiation exposure and why transcontinental flights are sometimes routed away from polar regions during severe solar storms. “[A single event upset is] sort of where the planes-falling-out-of-the-sky idea comes from,” Elvidge says. “You can exaggerate it to the point where it seems comical and absurd and therefore not going to happen—or, you know, it’s sensible to talk about the real impacts. If you’ve got a pilot who’s just had 2,000 warning lights come on, nothing’s going to break [the aircraft], but it’s going to be fairly stressful.”</p> <p>The wider and more realistic concern for electronic systems is damage to power grids. For that reason, space weather forecasting is key.</p> <h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2> <p>Key to space weather forecasting is the distinction between solar flares and CMEs. If a flare is the muzzle flash of a gunshot, the CME is the bullet. The x-rays and extreme ultraviolet radiation from flares reach Earth at near light-speed, and by the time we observe them, their effects—such as disruptions of high-frequency radio signals or satellite navigation systems—are already being felt.</p> <p>“We cannot predict when a flare will occur,” Palmerio says, although closely monitoring sunspots and other denizens of solar active regions can allow for educated guesses. “There is a lot of research going on. For example, are there tiny features we can see on the sun that can be considered precursors of flaring activity?”</p> <p>CMEs are relatively easier to forecast, in large part because they almost always begin with an especially strong flare yet move far more slowly. While flares take just eight minutes or so to reach Earth, CMEs can take up to three days. In addition, certain space weather satellites can act as an early warning system and send back data on the strength of any incoming CME before it starts washing over the planet’s power grids.</p> <p>The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) operated by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are examples. “We’ve worked closely with the power industry to help them prepare for these things and mitigate the impact,” says Rob Steenburgh, acting lead of NOAA’s Space Weather Forecast Office. “So we notify them when we think we know what’s coming.” Grid operators, Steenburgh says, can then take actions to mitigate possible threats, such as decreasing total power output or bringing more backup equipment online.</p> <p>None of this is to say there are no threats. A major unknown in space weather forecasting is when the next “big one” will occur—the next Carrington-level storm or even a storm 100 times more energetic than that. Estimates vary from once per 100 years for a Carrington-level event, according to Elvidge, to <a href="https://theconversation.com/radioactive-traces-in-tree-rings-reveal-earths-history-of-unexplained-radiation-storms-193080#:~:text=around%20once%20every%20thousand%20years">once per millennia</a> for ones that are much more powerful. A 2022 study of tree rings, which can record prehistoric solar storms in their growth, found evidence that huge radiation spikes, dubbed Miyake events, <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspa.2022.0497">occurred several times</a> across millennia. If caused by gargantuan solar flares, such events would be enough to cause significant disruption to power grids and satellites today. Yet the events do not seem to have a consistent relationship with the solar cycle, and some appeared to last longer than a year—far longer than any known flare—so their true origins remain a mystery.</p> <p>“As a person who works with this every day, I am way more scared of a ‘doomsday’ derived from terrestrial weather like forest fires, hurricanes and extreme weather,” Palmerio concludes. “At every solar cycle, it’s as if we forgot what happened in the previous one. In [the cycle that stretched from 1996 to 2008], we saw really strong events. And I’m pretty sure that most people didn’t even know those events happened…. We have to monitor, and we have to be prepared. But we do not have to lose sleep over this.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The sun is unleashing powerful outbursts that could strike Earth, but these events are far more common—and much less worrisome—than some hyped headlines suggest (redirect to SciAm)]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maths on a Mug 15</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Maths_on_a_Mug_15/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maths on a Mug 15"/><published>2023-01-14T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-14T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Maths_on_a_Mug_15</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Maths_on_a_Mug_15/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This is a “simple” <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/tag/mathsonamug/" target="\_blank">#MathsOnAMug</a>. Simple, but very important. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" target="\_blank">Bayes’ theorem</a>:</p> \[P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)P(B).\] <p>This relates the probability of observing \(A\) given that \(B\) is true where \(A\) and \(B\) are events, we also require that the probability of \(B\) does not equal 0 (i.e. \(P(B)\neq 0\)). It allows us to find the probability of a cause, given an effect.</p> <p>Bayes’ can lead to some surprising, count-intuitive, results. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_House" target="\_blank">Dr. House</a> never thinks his patients have Lupus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus" target="\_blank">Lupus</a> is a condition where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead attack plasma proteins which can lead to blood clots. It is believed that 2% of the population have lupus. Suppose that a test is 98% accurate if a person has the disease and 74% accurate if they do not. Given the 98% accuracy of the test, should House really assume his patient with a positive result doesn’t have Lupus?</p> <p>We can check the probability using Bayes’ theorem. Let L represent Lupus, T the test and 1 and 0 positive/negative respectively (I’ll leave as an exercise to the reader to calculate the individual probabilities):</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} P(L=1|T=1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(T=1|L=1)P(L=1)}{P(T=1)},\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{(0.98)(0.02)}{0.0196 + 0.2548},\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{0.0196}{0.2744},\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.0715 \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So House’s insight is sensible, even given a positive result there is only a 7.14% chance of the person actually having Lupus!</p> <p>How we interpret Bayes’ theorem depends on how we interpret probability, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="\_blank">Bayesian</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability" target="\_blank">Frequentist</a> interpretation. This is a long running fight in mathematics, and it is worth reading about it to see where you come down on the argument. I’ll leave you with a quote from Savage (<a href="http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/0486623491" target="\_blank">1954</a>).</p> <blockquote> <p>It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability.
