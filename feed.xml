But what I was thinking about this morning is how many people just turn on the TV and watch whatever is on, is that something we can work out from TV videwing figures?</p> <p>To start with lets consider “Grey’s Anatomy”. The viewing figure data is from <a href="http://abcmedianet.com/web/homepage/default.aspx" target="_blank">ABC Medianet</a> and initially we just plot the number of viewers per episode which results in the below graph.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/overall2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/overall2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/overall2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/overall2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The first thing to notice in the above plot, is the large spike of around 38 million viewers for episode 24. This is caused by being the lead out show after Super Bowl XL. The brown circles plotted represent the start of a new season, as very often a new season (with the associated advertising) leads to a bump in viewing figures.</p> <p>We can also see from the plot that over time the number of viewers for the show has steadily decreased. And the red and blue curves are polynomial fits to the data to try and track that change in viewers. The red curve ignores the viewing figure from after the Super Bowl, treating it as an outlier. To look at the variation in users we can subtract the overall trend of viewers from the data and just look at the “noise”.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/data-minus-trend-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/data-minus-trend-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/data-minus-trend-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/data-minus-trend.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>However, this “noise” also contains the trend of an increase in viewers at the start of a new season and this diminishing over the season. To try and remove this we look at the Hilbert-Huang transform of the data minus the trend, breaking the curve into 7 intrinsic mode functions (IMF):</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/IMFs-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/IMFs-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/IMFs-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/IMFs.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>What we discover in the 4th IMF is the following trend, made larger below so it is more visible, with the red vertical lines indicating where a new season begins.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/EMD-Season-Start-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/EMD-Season-Start-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/EMD-Season-Start-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/EMD-Season-Start.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>You can see that the peaks do not always match where a season begins (which was also reflected in the very first plot), but very often they do. This means that we can now plot the true “fluctuations” in viewer numbers by subtracting the above graph from our “noise” graph.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/viewer-noise-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/viewer-noise-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/viewer-noise-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/viewer-noise.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>It looks like, in this plot, that the noise in viewing figures is decreasing over time. However since we know that there is a decreasing number of viewers we calculate the normalised standard deviation for each season. This is done by finding the standard deviation of a season and dividing it by the range of viewers for that season. This is presented in the table below.</p> <div class="language-markdown highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>| Season Number | Standard Deviation (Millions) | Range of Viewers (Million) | (Standard Deviation / Range ) <span class="se">\*</span> 100 (%) |

However, for ease, we are going to ignore friction!

Equating the forces at the top of the loop we have the weight of the car (\(mg\)) plus the normal force (\(N\)) equal to the centrifugal force (\(F\)), which is given by \(F=\frac{mv^2}{r}\) where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

We now proceed with the energy argument.</p> <p>The total energy at the top of the loop is equal to the potential energy at the top plus the kinetic energy at the top, respectively these are:</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} PE_t &amp;=&amp; mgh = 2mgr,\\ KE_t &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}mv_t^2 = \frac{1}{2}mgr. \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>Thus the total energy at the top is:</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} E_t &amp;=&amp; 2mgr+\frac{1}{2}mgr,\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{5}{2}mgr. \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>We now find the total energy at the bottom, since there is no potential energy, this is simply the kinetic energy,</p> \[E_b = \frac{1}{2}mv_b^2.\] <p>Where \(v_b\) is the speed we are looking for. With our assumptions, the energy at the top (\(E_t\)) equals the energy at the bottom (\(E_b\)) giving</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} E_b &amp;=&amp; E_t,\\ \frac{1}{2}mv_b^2 &amp;=&amp; \frac{5}{2}mgr,\\ mv_b^2 &amp;=&amp; 5mgr,\\ v_b^2 &amp;=&amp; 5gr,\\ v_b &amp;=&amp; \sqrt{5gr}. \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>Thus we have found the speed required to complete a loop the loop of radius \(r\).

In this bonding there are two left over pairs of electrons, and the whole molecule creates a rough tetrahedron.</p> <p>“Luckily” (from the point of view of this post) when dealing with hexagonal ice (ice Ih) (i.e. natural ice /snow) we get a perfect tetrahedron (see here and here for more details of this), hence the six-fold symmetry in snowflakes.</p> <p>Now we know this, we can work out just how unique the snow outside is, or the ice in your cup (perhaps you’re reading this in a warmer climate!) is. How many possible ways are there to create a tetrahedral structure like hexagonal ice?</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/water_molecule-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/water_molecule-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/water_molecule-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/water_molecule.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>With a little bit of thinking, and twisting the above image in your head, hopefully you’ll agree with me that there are 6 ways of arranging the water molecule in the ‘ice tetrahedron’. However, not every one of these possibilities is possible. Read the Wikipedia page on hydrogen bonds and then you’ll see that in fact only \(\frac{3}{2}\)  possible orientations are allowed. That is, for a crystal of N molecules, there are \(\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^N\) ways to arrange the molecules inside that crystal.</p> <p>So, let us consider a snowball, say of 3 cm radius. How many molecules are there in that much snow?</p> <p>There are a number of ways of arriving at the number of molecules, but I’m going to go for the way which came to me first (rather than perhaps the best / most elegant solution (not that I know what that is!)). I considered the snow as water (because I know the molar mass of water!), so for that we just need to know the density of snow. Not so easy, it depends on various factors; as you have no doubt experienced, new snow feels a lot less dense then snow that has been sitting around for a week. Typically the densities vary between 8% and 50% the density of water. Once the snow is on the ground it settles under its own weight to a density of around 30%. Since the snow that got me thinking about this is fairly new, we’ll go for a density of 20%. That means 30 cm of snow would make 6 cm of water.</p> <p>So our 3 cm radius snow ball has a volume of \(\approx 113\,cm^3\) which would be \(22.6\, cm^3\) of water. A cubic centimetre of water weights 1 grams so the water content of our snowball would weigh 22.6 g.</p> <p>The molar mass of water is \(18.01528\, g\cdot mol^{-1}\) so there is</p> \[22.6 \times\frac{1}{18.01528}\approx 1.25 \mbox{ moles}.\] <p>Multiplying this number by Avogadro’s number (\(6.02\times 10^{23}\)) yields the number of molecules in the snowball:</p> \[1.25 \times 6.02\times 10^{23} \approx 7.5\times 10^{23}.\] <p>That means the possible number of orientations of the water molecules is</p> \[\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^{7.5\times 10^{23}} \approx 10^{10^{23}}.\] <p>So how big is that number? Well it is stupidly big. We estimate that there is something like \(10^{80}\) atoms in the universe which isn’t even close to that number. So it is safe to say that every snowball that has ever been made, or ever will be made by people all over the Earth for the rest of the history of this planet, will always have a unique arrangements of water molecules!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Investigating the number of unique snowballs]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Crawshaw Method (for Quadratics)</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/the-Crawshaw-method/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Crawshaw Method (for Quadratics)"/><published>2012-05-01T20:49:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-05-01T20:49:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/the-Crawshaw-method</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/the-Crawshaw-method/"><![CDATA[<p>Something all High School students (and above) need to know is how to factorize quadratic equations. However I am amazed how few people know a decent (and easy) way of doing this!</p> <p>I’ll keep this as simple as possible, and just show you how to use the method.</p> <p>First we consider a simple case (and sadly this is where a lot of the problems arise from!), we want to factorize the quadratic equation,</p> \[x^2+5x+6.\] <p>Now, as far as I know, it is universally taught that to factorize this you have to “find” two numbers that times together to make \(+6\) (the constant term) and add to make \(+5\) (the linear term). This is pretty easy, we choose the numbers \(+2\) and \(+3\), and then we simply write down the answer,</p> \[x^2+5x+6=(x+2)(x+3).\] <p>Easy.</p> <p>The problem is when you arrive at a question like,</p> \[3x^2-7x-6.\] <p>If we proceed in the same way as we were `taught’ above we need to find two numbers which times together to make \(-6\) and add to make \(-7\). We then need to try and work out what on Earth to do with these numbers, the problem is, it is not in any way obvious and quite a lot of guess work, or at least trial and error, is required.  The answer we would be looking for was</p> \[3x^2-7x-6=(3x+2)(x-3).\] <p>I think what is clear is that we need a concise, dare I say easy, method to solve any quadratic equation.</p> <p>Let me introduce the <em>Crawshaw method</em>.</p> <p>We first will apply the method to the ‘easy’ quadratic formula (the method is identical for all quadratics), you only need to remember that \(x=1x\), only we don’t write the \(1\). So the quadratic to solve is \(x^2+5x+6\).</p> <p>The first step of the method tells us that we need to find two numbers which add together to make \(+5\) and times to make \(1\times 6=6\), that is, the coefficient of the quadratic term (\(1\)) multiplied by the constant term (\(6\)). These numbers are \(2\) and \(3\).</p> <p>The second step is to rewrite the linear term as a combination of the numbers we have just found. So for this question the linear term is \(+5x\) the numbers we found were \(2\) and \(3\) so we will replace \(+5x\) in the quadratic with \(+2x+3x\). So our quadratic is now:</p> \[x^2+2x+3x+6.\] <p>Which is of course the exact same equation but now we can continue with the method.</p> <p>We now draw an imaginary line down the middle of the equation:</p> \[x^2+2x\quad/\quad+3x+6.\] <p>Next we factorize the left hand side, getting:</p> \[x(x+2)\quad/\quad+3x+6.\] <p>We then need to factorize the right hand side, but making sure that the bracket terms are the same, i.e.</p> \[x(x+2)\quad/\quad+3(x+2).\] <p>Then finally we get our two brackets (for the factorized answer) as the one bracket we already have, and the two terms that are on the outside of the brackets (i.e. in this case \(x\) and \(+3\)). Thus our answer becomes</p> \[(x+2)(x+3).\] <p>This method does seem more difficult for this ‘easy’ equation (i.e. one where the coefficient of the quadratic term is \(1\)) but the beauty of the Crawshaw method is that it works exactly the same for all quadratic equations.</p> <p>Now let us consider the second equation, that is \(3x^2-7x-6\). We approach it in exactly the same way.</p> <p>First find two numbers which times together to make \(3\times -6 = -18\) (that is the coefficient of the quadratic term multiplied by the constant term) and add together to make \(-7\). Such numbers are \(-9\) and \(+2\). So we now rewrite the linear term with these numbers (i.e. replacing \(-7x=-9x+2x\)) so we get:</p> \[3x^2-9x+2x-6.\] <p>Now we draw an imaginary line down the middle and factorize both sides of the equation:</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} 3x^2-9x \quad &amp;/&amp; \quad 2x-6,\\ 3x(x-3) \quad &amp;/&amp; \quad +2(x-3). \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So we then have our factorized solution,</p> \[3x^2-7x-6=(3x+2)(x-3).\] <p>See, wasn’t that easier?</p> <p>I present to you, the Crawshaw method.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How to solve quadratic equations using the Crawshaw method]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A Short History of Nearly Everything - Some Corrections</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/a-short-history/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Short History of Nearly Everything - Some Corrections"/><published>2012-03-31T12:38:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-03-31T12:38:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/a-short-history</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/a-short-history/"><![CDATA[<p>I have just finished the book “A Short History of Nearly Everything” by Bill Bryson and I thought it was absolutely fantastic. There were a couple of mistakes that I noticed (and I am sure others that I did not - by ‘noticed’ I mean ‘didn’t believe the numbers and so checked them out’) that I thought I should correct. This post just provides a few scientific corrections, and is meant in <strong>no way as disrespect to what I believe to be a truly brilliant book</strong>.</p> <blockquote> <p>On a diagram of the solar system to scale, with Earth reduced to about the diameter of a pea, Jupiter would be over a thousand feet away and Pluto would be a mile and a half distant (and about the size of a bacterium, so you wouldn’t be able to see it anyway).</p> </blockquote> <p>Okay, assume that the radius of a pea is about \(4\) millimetres, or \(4 \times 10^{-3}\) metres. The mean radius of the Earth is \(6.371 \times 10^3\) metres, or the peas radius is \(\frac{1}{1592750000}\) of the Earth’s. We will use this fraction as the scale for the rest of the system. The distance between the Earth and Jupiter is \(5.808\) AU so on our scale that turns out to be \(1790\) feet. Pluto (which is \(32.15\) AU away) would be \(1.88\) miles away. So in this sense Bryson underestimated their distances (slightly). However, as for the size of Pluto, it has a mean radius of \(1.173 \times 10^6\) metres, so on our scale that would become \(7.4 \times 10^{-4}\) metres, i.e. a total diameter of 1.5 millimetres, very visible and about 75 times larger than a median bacterium!</p> <blockquote> <p>Protons are so small that a little dib of ink like the dot on this i can hold something in the region of 500,000,000,000 of them, rather more than the number of seconds contained in half a million years.</p> </blockquote> <p>I think the approximate size of a ‘dot’ is about \(0.5\) millimetres, so that means the area, in metres, of such a dot is: \(\pi\cdot 0.00025^2=1.963\times 10^{-7}\). The size of a proton is \(8.77 \times 10^{-16}\) metres, and so the number of protons that would fit in such a dot is \(223,887,732\). Or \(2233\) times less than the Bryson stated number. As for the number of seconds in half a million years: \(1 \mbox{ year } = 31556926 \mbox{ seconds}\) and \(500,000 \mbox{ years } = 15,800,000,000,000 \mbox{ seconds}\). Quite a lot more than what was stated, in fact, \(500,000,000,000\) seconds is only 15844 years.</p> <blockquote> <p>Even so, it [the Voyager spacecraft] took them nine years to reach Uranus and a dozen to cross the orbit of Pluto.</p> </blockquote> <p>Actually, Voyager 1 never got to Uranus nor cross the orbit of Pluto, only Voyager 2 did.</p> <blockquote> <p>[Betelgeuse is] fifty thousand light years away.</p> </blockquote> <p>Betelgeuse is around \(643 \pm 143\) light years away.</p> <blockquote> <p>It is thought that our entire planet may contain, at any given moment, fewer than twenty francium atoms.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is almost certainly a lot more than twenty francium atoms, according to <a href="https://perey.org/genealogy/MP%202.pdf">Adloff and Kauffman</a>, there is 550 grams in the Earth’s crust.</p> <blockquote> <p>It took thousands of workers to clear 1.8 billion tonnes of debris from the 6.5 hectares of the World Trade Center site.</p> </blockquote> <p>1.8 million tonnes.</p> <blockquote> <p>It rises exponentially, so that a 7.3 quake is fifty ties more powerful than a 6.3 earthquake and 2,500 time more powerful than a 5.3 earthquake.</p> </blockquote> <p>Exactly what the mistake is here depends slightly on what you interpret the word <em>powerful</em> means. The <em>size</em> of an earthquake increases by a factor of 10 as magnitude increases by one whole number. So a magnitude 7.3 earthquake is <strong>10 times</strong> larger than a 6.3, and <strong>100 times</strong> larger than 5.3. The amount of <em>energy released</em> increases by a factor of 31.6 \(\left(10^{1.5}\right)\). So a 7.3 earthquake releases roughly 32 times more energy than a magnitude 6.3; and about 1,000 times more energy than a 5.3.</p> <blockquote> <p>It has been calculated that if you sunk a well to the center [of the Earth] and dropped a brick into it, it would take only 45 minutes for it to hit the bottom.</p> </blockquote> <p>The terminal velocity of an object falling through the air is the maximum speed that the object will reach when the resistance of the medium through which it falls (in this case, air) prevents further acceleration. This velocity depends on various factors, including the mass and aerodynamic properties of the object (such as its shape and surface area), as well as the density of the air. For a brick, calculating its terminal velocity involves considering its drag coefficient, cross-sectional area perpendicular to the direction of motion, and mass. Using sensible estimates for this value we could calculate the terminal velocity of a house brick to be approximately 45 meters per second. Given that the Earth’s radius is approximately 6371 km, the brick would take about 39 hours to fall to the centre (given all the other difficulties with this thought experiment!).</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="books"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some corrections in A Short History of Nearly Everything]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">1 = 2</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/1-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="1 = 2"/><published>2012-02-17T14:07:00+00:00</published><updated>2012-02-17T14:07:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/1-2</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2012/1-2/"><![CDATA[<p>Many people have seen “proofs” that \(1 = 2\).
