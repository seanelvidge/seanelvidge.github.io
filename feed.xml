Modern players are scoring at unprecedented rates, and while this is undoubtedly exciting for fans, it raises an important question: Are today’s goal-scoring feats truly comparable to those of past legends?</p> <p>The landscape of international football has evolved significantly. The expansion of FIFA membership has introduced many new, smaller nations into the competitive arena. This influx has led to more matches where traditional football powerhouses face off against developing teams, often resulting in lopsided scorelines. Consequently, contemporary players have more opportunities to inflate their goal tallies against weaker opposition.</p> <p>This shift poses a challenge when attempting to compare the goal-scoring records of current players with those from previous eras. The legends of the past often played fewer matches against a more consistent level of competition, making their goal tallies a reflection of performances against relatively equal opponents.</p> <p>So, how can we level the playing field and make fair comparisons across different football eras?</p> <h2 id="introducing-a-weighted-goal-system">Introducing a Weighted Goal System</h2> <p>To address this disparity, I embarked on a project to adjust goal records by accounting for the relative strength of the opposition. The idea is to assign a weighting to each goal based on the difficulty of scoring against a particular team at the time of the match. This method aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of a player’s goal-scoring achievements.</p> <h3 id="utilizing-elo-ratings">Utilizing ELO Ratings</h3> <p>The foundation of this approach lies in the ELO rating system, a method originally devised for ranking chess players but now widely adopted across various sports, including football. ELO ratings provide a dynamic measure of a team’s strength, updating after each match based on the result and the quality of the opposition.</p> <p>By leveraging historical ELO ratings, we can assess the relative strength of any two teams at the time they played. This allows us to calculate a weighting factor for each goal scored, reflecting the challenge posed by the opponent.</p> <h3 id="the-weighting-formula">The Weighting Formula</h3> <p>The weighting for each goal is determined using the following formula:</p> \[\text{Weight} = 1 - k\times\frac{E-O}{E}\] <p>Where, $E$ is the ELO rating of England before the match, $O$ is the ELO rating of the opposition before the match and $k$ a scaling constant that adjusts the sensitivity of the weighting to the difference in ELO ratings.</p> <p>This formula adjusts the weight of a goal based on how much stronger or weaker the opposition is relative to England:</p> <ul> <li>If England faces a stronger team ($O &gt; E$), the weighting increases above 1, acknowledging the greater difficulty.</li> <li>If England faces a weaker team ($O &lt; E$), the weighting decreases below 1, reflecting the relatively easier challenge.</li> <li>The constant $k$ controls how much the difference in ratings affects the weighting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="interpreting-the-weighting">Interpreting the Weighting</h3> <p>Adjusting the $k$ value alters the impact of the opposition’s strength:</p> <ul> <li>A higher $k$ value (e.g., 2) amplifies the effect, giving more weight to goals against stronger teams and less to those against weaker ones.</li> <li>A lower $k$ value (e.g., 1) minimizes the effect, resulting in a more uniform weighting across different opponents.</li> </ul> <p>By experimenting with different $k$ values, we can fine-tune the system to balance fairness and sensitivity, ensuring that exceptional performances against top-tier teams are appropriately recognized while maintaining a reasonable value for consistent scoring against all opponents.</p> <p>For the rest of this post we use a value of $k=2$.</p> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>When I last wrote a post similar to this, Wayne Rooney had just <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2015/Rooney-50/">broke the England National team goal record with 50 goals</a>. Since then Kane has broke this record again (at the time of writing) with 69 goals. Using the above approach the updated top 10 of England goal scorers are:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Ranking</th> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Goals</th> <th style="text-align: center">Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">Harry Kane</td> <td style="text-align: center">45</td> <td style="text-align: center">69</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gary Lineker</td> <td style="text-align: center">37</td> <td style="text-align: center">48</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">Bobby Charlton</td> <td style="text-align: center">36</td> <td style="text-align: center">49</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td style="text-align: center">Jimmy Greaves</td> <td style="text-align: center">35</td> <td style="text-align: center">44</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5</td> <td style="text-align: center">Wayne Rooney</td> <td style="text-align: center">34</td> <td style="text-align: center">53</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> <td style="text-align: center">Michael Owen</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> <td style="text-align: center">40</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">7</td> <td style="text-align: center">Alan Shearer</td> <td style="text-align: center">23</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">8</td> <td style="text-align: center">Tom Finney</td> <td style="text-align: center">23</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">9</td> <td style="text-align: center">Nat Lofthouse</td> <td style="text-align: center">22</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> <td style="text-align: center">Frank Lampard</td> <td style="text-align: center">21</td> <td style="text-align: center">29</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You can see that whilst Kane is still number 1 - his number of goals are significantly less. (Note that the adjusted number of goals here have been rounded to the nearest goal for ease of reading).</p> <p>As may be expected Kane has the biggest change between actual goals scored (69) and the weighted number of goals (45) with a difference of 24, perphaps reaffirming the theory that modern day players are scoring a significant amount of their goals against weaker opposition than in the past. Gary Lineker moves from 4th in the all time list to 2nd.</p> <p>At the other end of the table we end up with a number of people (41) who (because of the rounding as well) move from having scored at least 1 for England to being on 0 goals, but only four who go from more than 1 to zero:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Goals</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Tammy Abraham</td> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Paul Ince</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Tyrone Mings</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">James Ward-Prowse</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Unfortuntaely Tammy Abraham’s 3 goals for England were scored against very much weaker opposition in the form of Montenegro (England won 7-0 on 14/11/19), Andorra (England won 0-5 on 09/10/21) and San Marino (England won 0-10 on 15/11/21).</p> <p>If you want to have a look at the data you can access it all <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/assets/files/england_elo_goal_data.csv">here</a>) (which also includes the “Adjusted Total” which weights Friendlies as 0.5 and “finals” as 2x (as per the description <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2015/Rooney-50/">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="football"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[By weighting international goals by strength of the opposition we can compare goal scoring prowess across the decades.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">World Cup 2018 Predictions</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/World_Cup_2018_Predictions/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="World Cup 2018 Predictions"/><published>2018-06-14T15:10:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-06-14T15:10:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/World_Cup_2018_Predictions</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/World_Cup_2018_Predictions/"><![CDATA[<p>The World Cup is almost upon us and so it’s time to make some predictions…</p> <p>My model, like a lot of others, is based on the <a href="https://www.eloratings.net/" target="\_blank">World Football Elo ratings (WFER)</a>. Which is a system that uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="\_blank">Elo rating system</a>. You can read all about Elo on those two links, but basically after every game a team gains or loses points. The change in points is dependent on the two rankings of the teams. If there is a large difference between the two teams and the lower ranking team wins then they would gain a lot more points than if the higher ranking team won (since it is expected that they should win).</p> <p>The rating system gives different weightings for the tournaments that games take place in. They rank them in the following order:</p> <ol> <li>World Cup finals,</li> <li>Continental championship finals and major intercontinental tournaments,</li> <li>World Cup and continental qualifiers and major tournaments,</li> <li>All other tournaments,</li> <li>Friendly matches.</li> </ol> <p>The WFER site takes into account all games that results could be found for (so goes all the way back to the first official International football game, between Scotland and England on 30 November 1872, 0-0).</p> <p>My model uses a combination of ensemble machine learning methods for classification problems, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest" target="\_blank">random decision forests</a>. Each <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree" target="\_blank">decision tree</a> in the ensemble is taken from a bootstrap sample of some training set where observations about an item (represented in the branches) can be used to drawn conclusions about the item’s target value (represented in the leaves). It is a standard technique which has a wide range of uses, including the evaluation of Wikipedia articles <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-46254-7_50" target="\_blank">quality and importance</a>.</p> <p>The model uses the WFER data for training, where all friendly matches have been removed (because very often sides don’t play a full strength team in those matches). Different combinations of training data results in different resulting models. Specifically, giving the model the rankings between the two teams and the result of the match (win, draw, loss) gives different results than if you just give the two teams rankings, but only results from major tournaments. For the final results the model has been trained using 76 decision trees with three different datasets:</p> <ol> <li>All (non-friendly) fixtures,</li> <li>All (non-friendly) fixtures since 1980,</li> <li>Fixtures from the World Cup, European Championships, Africa Cup of Nations and Copa America.</li> </ol> <p>The final results are then an average of the output of each of the three trained models.</p> <p>To test the success of the model part of the data (15% in this case) is held back and then compared against. After training the model, the accuracy of the model predictions are compared to the held back data. In this case the model was shown to be 94.8% accurate in predicting a win, draw or loss.</p> <p>The World Cup can then be simulated running the model for each match. The model returns probabilities of each of the outcomes so the same results don’t happen each time. The simulations are ran 10,000 times in order to get success probabilities for each team:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wc2018/WC_plot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/wc2018/WC_plot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/wc2018/WC_plot-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/wc2018/WC_plot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>ou can see the model predicts that Brazil have by far the greatest chance of winning the World Cup, over twice as much as the next most likely team, Germany.</p> <p>As I mentioned earlier in the post, a lot of people are making predictions of the World Cup results.

Easter this year (2018) was on April 1st, next year (2019) Easter falls on April 21st, so 385 days. But what is more interesting is what is the range and distribution of the possible number of days between consecutive Easter’s?</p> <p>I’ve previously written about the distribution of pancake day/Shrove Tuesday. In that article I discussed the (very) complicated way that Easter is calculated and provide a computus for finding Easter Sunday. Looping through the years 1 to 9999 (the extreme limits of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/datetime.html" target="\_blank">Python’s datetime module</a>) we actually find that there are only 4 possible options for the number of days until next Easter: 350, 357, 378 and 385 days.</p> <p>Given that Easter can fall on any day between March 22nd and April 25th I think this is quite a surprising result. The four options are not evenly distributed:</p> <ul> <li>350 days – 24.5%</li> <li>357 days – 38.7%</li> <li>378 days – 5.1%</li> <li>386 days – 31.7%</li> </ul> <p>and we won’t have a 378 day Easter gap until 2021/22 and then 2048/49 after that.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="python"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many sleeps is it until next Easter?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Was there room on the door for two?</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/Was_there_room_on_the_door_for_two/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Was there room on the door for two?"/><published>2018-04-06T10:09:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-04-06T10:09:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/Was_there_room_on_the_door_for_two</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/Was_there_room_on_the_door_for_two/"><![CDATA[<p>Could Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) from the motion picture ‘Titanic’ both have survived by both floating on the door? (Clearly there are a load of spoilers in this article – but the film did come out over 20 years ago so I’m <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=film+spoilers+statute+of+limitations" target="\_blank">not going to worry</a> too much about it).</p> <p>[Note: This is a copy of an article I wrote in 2011, which is no longer available online so I’ve repeated it here for prosperity]</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>During the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/">1997 motion picture ‘Titanic’</a> by James Cameron there is a famous scene involving the two main characters, Jack Dawson (as played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) towards the end of the film. The scene involves Jack in the ocean and Rose floating on a wooden object, Jack dies and Rose survives, however the question we ask is, need Jack of died? Was there room (and spare buoyancy) for two? This is a question which appears repeatedly (e.g. <a href="#1">[1]</a> and <a href="#2">[2]</a>) on the internet but with varying answers, but hopefully this article can draw a conclusion to the discussion.</p> <p>The first point to settle is that Rose is not floating on a door and is instead floating on a piece of wood panelling. The panelling in the film is based upon a recovered piece, homed at the <a href="https://maritimemuseum.novascotia.ca/" target="\_blank">Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, in Halifax, Nova Scotia</a> <a href="#3">[3]</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/door-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/door-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/door-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/door.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 1.

Archimedes supposedly exclaimed “Eureka!” when he discovered a fundamental principle of buoyancy, which relates buoyancy to displacement. Indeed this principle is still named after him, and first appears as Proposition 5 in <a href="#4">[4]</a>.</p> <blockquote> <p>Archimedes Principle: Any solid lighter than a fluid will, if placed in the fluid, be so far immersed that the weight of the solid will be equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.</p> </blockquote> <p>This tells us that the buoyancy force, $F_B$, is equal to the weight, $W$, of the object placed in the fluid, so $F_B=W$. Weight is equal to the mass of the object times gravity, $g$, and mass is equal to density, $\rho$, times volume, $V$, giving rise to the more well known equation:</p> \[F_B=\rho Vg.\] <h2 id="could-they-both-fit">Could they both fit?</h2> <p>The first question to resolve is, “Could Rose and Jack have both fit on the panelling?”.</p> <p>The solution to this problem has been ‘demonstrated’ previously:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/titanicSpace/fitondoor-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/fitondoor-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/fitondoor-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/titanicSpace/fitondoor.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 2.

Namely:</p> <ol> <li>What is the size of the panel?</li> <li>What is the density of the panel (what is it made from)</li> <li>What is the mass of Rose?</li> <li>What is the mass of Jack?</li> <li>What is the density of the water</li> </ol> <h3 id="panel-size">Panel Size</h3> <p>First off we approximate the size of the panelling. A common mistake (or at least a common oversight) when approaching this problem is taking the panelling to be a rectangle. This is obvious from the overhead shot of the panelling and so I’ve created a more reasonable approximation of the panelling:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 3. The approximate shape of the panel.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Now that we have the shape of the panelling we need to find the correct dimensions. All that is required is the length of one of the sides, and everything else can be calculated from that scale. From personal communication with the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic the size of the actual panel which the fictional one is based on is 150 cm by 105 cm by (~)3 cm (“the thickness of this panel is not recorded in the record, it is currently behind glass and is estimated at 3 cm”). However we can quickly see that the panelling in the film is larger than this, we can see this by comparing it with Rose’s height.</p> <p>It is a pretty safe assumption that Rose’s height is equal to Kate Winslet’s height, and she is quoted as saying she is 5 foot 6 inches (167.6 cm) <a href="#6">[6]</a>.

The first image seems to imply a depth of approximately 0.1 metres, which we find, via scaling, from Jack’s hand. However we can see that the edge which is above the water is clearly thicker than the rest of the door. Something that should be considered (especially when calculating the mass of the door). In the other figures we see that the panelling gets considerably thicker (about twice as thick again) further down (the section is underwater in the first figure). We are left to speculate whether this extra depth covers the whole of the panel, as in:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing_sideon2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing_sideon2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing_sideon2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/titanicSpace/door_drawing_sideon2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 8.

Head on view of the panelling.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>There can be no way of knowing for sure which possibility is the correct one. However the first option would result in a considerable mass, which would probably result in the panelling not being able to float, which we know is a fallacy. So for the rest of the document we consider that we are in the second case.</p> <h3 id="roses-mass">Rose’s Mass</h3> <p>Again, let us assume that Rose’s mass is the same as Kate Winslet’s. This is hard to pin down, but via various internet sources this appears to be between 54 and 59kg <a href="#7">[7]</a> <a href="#8">[8]</a>, so, for an approximation, we take the midpoint and use 56.5kg. It is also worth noting that the wet clothes that Rose was wearing would have added a considerable mass to this total. However, for simplicity, we ignore this factor.</p> <h3 id="jacks-mass">Jack’s Mass</h3> <p>For Jack’s mass we use Leonardo DiCaprio’s mass, which is between 72.5 and 75kg <a href="#9">[9]</a>. So, for our calculations, we use 74kg. Again this would have been greater due to the wet clothes.</p> <h3 id="panel-density">Panel Density</h3> <p>The density of the wood panelling is key in our study as this will determine the mass of the panel, which is an important factor on whether the panelling will sink or float. We can immediately deduce some bounds on the density, thanks again to the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax. According to the museum the piece of panelling is made of oak. Then from <a href="#10">[10]</a> the density of oak varies between 600 and 900 $kg m^{−3}^. Initially a value of 750 $kg m^{−3}$ (the midpoint) is used and then later look at what values of panel density would require which panel depths.</p> <h3 id="panel-mass">Panel Mass</h3> <p>Using the panel density the mass of the panel can be calculated.</p> <p>The volume of the panel in Figure 9 can be found by calculating the volume of the three individual sections which make up the panel. The ‘top’ section has a volume of $0.013 m^3$. The ‘middle’ section $0.19 m^3$ and finally the ‘bottom’ section is $0.011 m^3$. This gives a total volume of $0.214 m^3$. Which, using the density value from the previous section, equates to a mass of $160.5 kg$.</p> <h3 id="water-density">Water Density</h3> <p>The density of water depends on two main factors, its temperature and the water salinity.</p> <p>On the night of the Titanic’s sinking the water temperature was reported to be 31 degrees Fahrenheit <a href="#11">[11]</a> <a href="#12">[12]</a>, which is approximately −0.56C.</p> <p>The salinity of ocean water varies with location. The Atlantic Ocean, where the Titanic sank, varies between 33 and 37 parts per thousand. According to NASA <a href="#13">[13]</a> the approximate salinity value of the Atlantic at the location where the Titanic sank (41.725, -130.05) is 36 parts per thousand. We can then use the water density calculator provided at <a href="#14">[14]</a> with the above values to find a calculated water density of $1029 kg m^{−3}$.</p> <h2 id="buoyancy">Buoyancy</h2> <p>We now come to the crux of the problem. Could the panelling have supported both Jack and Rose?</p> <p>First we consider the case which occurred in the film, Rose lying on the panelling. To do this we consider the forces acting upon the panelling, the downward force due to weight, and the upward force due to buoyancy. The only variable we do not know is the displaced volume. Since we know the area of the panel which is in contact with the water we are left to find the height that makes up the submerged portion of the panelling. Thus we actually find the depth to which the panelling sinks, clearly we require this to be greater than the total depth of the panel, in order for some of it to remain above water. We equate the buoyancy force, $F_B$, with the total weight in the system. We use $M_R$, $M_P$ and $M_J$ to represent the mass of Rose, the panel and Jack respectively.</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} F_B &amp;=&amp; W, \\ \rho Vg &amp;=&amp; (M_R+M_P)g,\\ \rho V &amp;=&amp; M_R+M_P,\\ 1029\times 1.9\times H &amp;=&amp; 56.5+160.5,\\ 1955H &amp;=&amp; 217,\\ H &amp;=&amp; 0.111. \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>Which says that the door sinks 11.1cm, but we only assumed a panel depth of 10cm! Thus, using our assumptions, Rose could not have floated on top of the panel and been completely above the water. However, since the only real knowledge of this system is that Rose can float on the panel we must adjust our assumptions.</p> <p>The first assumption to try changing would be our choice of wood density, since this was chosen to be the midpoint of a fairly large range. By rearranging Equation 5 we can plot a graph of densities against how much the panelling would sink:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/titanicSpace/graph_density-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/graph_density-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/graph_density-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/titanicSpace/graph_density.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 11. Graph of wood density against depth the panel would sink to.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This shows that the least the panel would sink is approximately 0.095 metres, which is less than the current assumed depth of the panel. Thus, if we assume a wood density of $600 kg m^{−3}$ then Rose could, like in the film, float on the panelling.</p> <p>This value of wood density gives a panel mass of 128.4 kg. Using this panel mass we can calculate that the panelling would sink 0.066 metres if nothing was on it, i.e. there would be approximately 3.5 centimetres floating above the water. This is a reasonable value, especially when you consider the Figure below:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/titanicSpace/Off_door-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/Off_door-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/Off_door-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/titanicSpace/Off_door.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 12. Screenshot from `Titanic’. Rose swimming away from the panelling, you can see the panel, floating, in the background.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>If we now repeat the above process, using the new panel mass, but also include Jack’s mass we can see whether Jack could also have floated on the panel.</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} \rho Vg &amp;=&amp; (M_R+M_P+M_J)g,\\ \rho V &amp;=&amp; M_R+M_P+M_J,\\ 1029\times 1.9\times H &amp;=&amp; 56.5+128.4+74,\\ 1955H &amp;=&amp; 258.9,\\ H &amp;=&amp; 0.132. \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So the panel would have sank 0.132 metres, or just over 13 centimetres, some 3 centimetres greater than the depth of the panelling.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>In summary, both Jack and Rose could have fitted on the piece of wooden panelling, but had they both have got on, the panel would have been submerged under water by 3.2 centimetres. However, it is likely that should they both have been on the panelling, they both would have survived (especially if they had sat). This is since the cooling rate is directly related to the amount of exposed surface area and body parts immersed in the water and the best chance of surviving accidental immersion in cold water (&lt;20C) is to keep as much of the body as possible out of the water at all times <a href="#12">[12]</a>. Jack certainly would have had a much better chance of survival, compared to the almost zero percent chance he had by staying in the water:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/titanicSpace/survival_time-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/survival_time-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/titanicSpace/survival_time-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/titanicSpace/survival_time.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <figcaption style="text-align: center; margin-top: 8px;">Figure 13. Human survival time in cold water.</figcaption> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The curves in the Figure indicate the expected survival times at different levels of body insulation in cold water. Low insulation is light or no clothing, medium is wet suit, and high is dry suit. Dashed lines indicated ranges at low or high body mass [12]. This shows that the length of time Jack could have survived in the water would have been approximately 30 minutes. Indeed, only one person who entered the water after the sinking of the Titanic, and was in it for more than a few minutes, survived the ordeal [12].</p> <p>So there was room on the door (panelling) for two.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p><a id="1">[1]</a> <a href="https://funypicforyou.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/titanic-floating-door-facts-explained.html" target="\_blank">https://funypicforyou.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/titanic-floating-door-facts-explained.html</a></p> <p><a id="2">[2]</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/sf1v2/ill_never_let_go_the_titanic_door_experiment/" target="\_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/sf1v2/ill_never_let_go_the_titanic_door_experiment/</a></p> <p><a id="3">[3]</a> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/trivia?tab=tr&amp;item=tr1076740" target="\_blank">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/trivia?tab=tr&amp;item=tr1076740</a></p> <p><a id="4">[4]</a> Archimedes of Syracuse (1897) The Works of Archimedes, edited in modern notation, with introductory chapters by T.L.

All draws are not equally likely, so what teams is your team likely to face?</p> <p>The format for the group stage was decided in September. Each team has been allocated a pot (1 to 4) based on “sporting principles”. The FIFA World Rankings (as of October 2017) were used to rank the teams in descending order (after Russia, who, as hosts, are the top seeds). The pots are:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 1</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 2</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 3</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 4</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Russia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Spain</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Denmark</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Serbia</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Germany</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Peru</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Iceland</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Nigeria</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Brazil</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Switzerland</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Costa Rica</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Australia</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Portugal</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">England</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Sweden</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Japan</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Argentina</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Colombia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Tunisia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Morocco</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Belgium</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Mexico</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Egypt</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Panama</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Poland</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Uruguay</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Senegal</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Korea Republic</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">France</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Croatia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Iran</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Saudi Arabia</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The exact rules for the draw are <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=11/news=close-up-on-final-draw-procedures-2921440.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_news_top">described here</a> (with a handy video explanation). Roughly speaking the rules are that, after Russia, who will definitely be assigned to Group A, a random team from each pot will be drawn, and then placed in the next available group (alphabetically) which they are allowed to be put in (subject to constraints such as splitting up the confederation). This process is repeated until all teams have been drawn.</p> <p>However, because of the rules of splitting confederations, each permutation of the 4 pots is not actually possible. So if you focus on one team you can look at what the probabilities of drawing other teams are. For example, the different probabilities of the draw for England are:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 1</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 2</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 3</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 4</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Russia (12.5%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Denmark (7.1%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Serbia (6.5%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Germany (9.5%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Iceland (7.1%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Nigeria (12.0%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Brazil (20.0%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Costa Rica (17.0%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Australia (13.5%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Portugal (9.5%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">England</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Sweden (7.1%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Japan (13.5%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Argentina (20.0%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Tunisia (15.4%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Morocco (12.1%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Belgium (9.5%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Egypt (15.4%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Panama (15.5%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Poland (9.5%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Senegal (15.4%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Korea Republic (13.5%)</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">France (9.5%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;"></td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Iran (15.4%)</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Saudi Arabia (13.5%)</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The above was created using 1,000,000 simulations.</p> <p>If you want to run your own experiment (with any team of your choice).

The idea being that the prices may be correlated with population density.</p> <p>Exactly how car insurers create their prices is not clear. But there is plenty of discussion online that it is, at least in part, related to your postcode. Many explain this relationship between price and postcode as being down to the crime rate in the area. However one of the PhD students in my office (Steve) said that it was to do with population density in the individual postcodes (the basic idea being more people = more accidents). Indeed, it has already been <a href="https://crimesciencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40163-021-00155-8">shown</a> that crime rate is correlated to population density. So showing a relationship between car insurance categories and population density, also shows a correlation between the categories and crime rate (as the online discussion suggests). So this all seemed like an interesting thought and so I went online and grabbed some data.</p> <p>The car insurance prices are split into 7 categories (‘A’ – ‘F’ and ‘Refer’) from <a href="https://www.theclayclothcompany.co.uk/blogs/motoring/car-insurance-postcodes">here</a> (with original data from motorcarinsuranceuk.co.uk which is no longer availablle). The site mentioned that the data is as “accurate as far as we know but there could be slight differences”. ‘A’ is a ‘good postcode / low risk’ and ‘Refer’ means that an individual would need to contact the individual car insurers (I take this to mean that ‘Refer’ is worse than an ‘F’). This conveniently gives a breakdown of category by postcode.</p> <p>The population density of each postcode can be found from the Office for National Statistics. Specifically from table <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs102ew">QS102EW</a>.</p> <p>Creating a box plot (including the mean) of the data (insurance category against population density) shows that there is a correlation between population density and car insurance category as Steve expected.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/popDen_carInsur-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/popDen_carInsur-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/popDen_carInsur-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/popDen_carInsur.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The lower the population density the better category car insurance you can get.</p> <p>The plot was created using the <a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn: statistical data visualization</a> package.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="internet"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the price of car insurance correlated with where you live?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Number of Unique Song Choices on Desert Island Discs</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2017/Unique_DID/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Number of Unique Song Choices on Desert Island Discs"/><published>2017-01-29T11:34:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-29T11:34:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2017/Unique_DID</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2017/Unique_DID/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr">Desert Island Discs</a> celebrates its 75th birthday today, and today’s guest is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08bz0rz">David Beckham</a>. Beckham will pick 8 song choices to take away with him on a desert island. What I wondered was, will all of his song choices have been picked by guests previously? With over 3,000 episodes there are going to be a lot of repetitions.</p> <p>Obviously the very first guest, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0nq">Vic Oliver</a> had to pick 8 unique song choices. There was no one before him! The second guest, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0nl">James Agate</a> also picked 8 unique choices (they were all different to Vic Oliver’s). This continued until the 8th guest, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0my">Joan Jay</a>, who only had 7 unique choices (she picked Ave Maria by Charles‐François Gounod the same as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0n8">Pat Kirkwood</a>). A quick scrape of the BBC 4 webpage gives us all of the song choices of each of the guests. Plotting the data as a histogram of ‘unique’ choices leads to a not unsurprising result:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/did1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/did1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/did1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/did1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>On average a castaway picks 3 unique choices, but really anything between 2 and 5 unique choices is quite probable. Picking 0 unique choices (~100 out of 3096 castaways) and all (8) unique choices (~50 out of 3096 castaways) is not very likely. The thing that is rather interesting though is if you look at the number of unique choices as a time series:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/did2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/did2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/did2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/did2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The data is obviously very noisy, with 0 and 8 unique choices scattered throughout the time series. But there is a clear trend. I’ve fitted a curve (least-squares) to the data and the results hopefully become clear. There was a decrease in the number of unique choices from the start of the show down until the mid 1980s, and since then there has been an increase again! I would guess that this has something to do with the explosion of popular music, the early choices are dominated by “famous” classical music pieces, but this has decreased over time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="internet"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many unique song choices to guests pick on Desert Island Discs?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Number of days until first Premier League manager sacking</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2016/Prem_Sackings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Number of days until first Premier League manager sacking"/><published>2016-10-03T18:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-03T18:27:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2016/Prem_Sackings</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2016/Prem_Sackings/"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll get straight to the point, on average the first Premier League manager is sacked after 77 days.</p> <p>Following the sacking of Francesco Guidolin from Swansea City today (52 days into the season), I wondered how long into the season the first manager is sacked on average.
