Modern players are scoring at unprecedented rates, and while this is undoubtedly exciting for fans, it raises an important question: Are today’s goal-scoring feats truly comparable to those of past legends?</p> <p>The landscape of international football has evolved significantly. The expansion of FIFA membership has introduced many new, smaller nations into the competitive arena. This influx has led to more matches where traditional football powerhouses face off against developing teams, often resulting in lopsided scorelines. Consequently, contemporary players have more opportunities to inflate their goal tallies against weaker opposition.</p> <p>This shift poses a challenge when attempting to compare the goal-scoring records of current players with those from previous eras. The legends of the past often played fewer matches against a more consistent level of competition, making their goal tallies a reflection of performances against relatively equal opponents.</p> <p>So, how can we level the playing field and make fair comparisons across different football eras?</p> <h2 id="introducing-a-weighted-goal-system">Introducing a Weighted Goal System</h2> <p>To address this disparity, I embarked on a project to adjust goal records by accounting for the relative strength of the opposition. The idea is to assign a weighting to each goal based on the difficulty of scoring against a particular team at the time of the match. This method aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of a player’s goal-scoring achievements.</p> <h3 id="utilizing-elo-ratings">Utilizing ELO Ratings</h3> <p>The foundation of this approach lies in the ELO rating system, a method originally devised for ranking chess players but now widely adopted across various sports, including football. ELO ratings provide a dynamic measure of a team’s strength, updating after each match based on the result and the quality of the opposition.</p> <p>By leveraging historical ELO ratings, we can assess the relative strength of any two teams at the time they played. This allows us to calculate a weighting factor for each goal scored, reflecting the challenge posed by the opponent.</p> <h3 id="the-weighting-formula">The Weighting Formula</h3> <p>The weighting for each goal is determined using the following formula:</p> \[\text{Weight} = 1 - k\times\frac{E-O}{E}\] <p>Where, $E$ is the ELO rating of England before the match, $O$ is the ELO rating of the opposition before the match and $k$ a scaling constant that adjusts the sensitivity of the weighting to the difference in ELO ratings.</p> <p>This formula adjusts the weight of a goal based on how much stronger or weaker the opposition is relative to England:</p> <ul> <li>If England faces a stronger team ($O &gt; E$), the weighting increases above 1, acknowledging the greater difficulty.</li> <li>If England faces a weaker team ($O &lt; E$), the weighting decreases below 1, reflecting the relatively easier challenge.</li> <li>The constant $k$ controls how much the difference in ratings affects the weighting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="interpreting-the-weighting">Interpreting the Weighting</h3> <p>Adjusting the $k$ value alters the impact of the opposition’s strength:</p> <ul> <li>A higher $k$ value (e.g., 2) amplifies the effect, giving more weight to goals against stronger teams and less to those against weaker ones.</li> <li>A lower $k$ value (e.g., 1) minimizes the effect, resulting in a more uniform weighting across different opponents.</li> </ul> <p>By experimenting with different $k$ values, we can fine-tune the system to balance fairness and sensitivity, ensuring that exceptional performances against top-tier teams are appropriately recognized while maintaining a reasonable value for consistent scoring against all opponents.</p> <p>For the rest of this post we use a value of $k=2$.</p> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>When I last wrote a post similar to this, Wayne Rooney had just <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2015/Rooney-50/">broke the England National team goal record with 50 goals</a>. Since then Kane has broke this record again (at the time of writing) with 69 goals. Using the above approach the updated top 10 of England goal scorers are:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Ranking</th> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Goals</th> <th style="text-align: center">Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">Harry Kane</td> <td style="text-align: center">45</td> <td style="text-align: center">69</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gary Lineker</td> <td style="text-align: center">37</td> <td style="text-align: center">48</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">Bobby Charlton</td> <td style="text-align: center">36</td> <td style="text-align: center">49</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td style="text-align: center">Jimmy Greaves</td> <td style="text-align: center">35</td> <td style="text-align: center">44</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5</td> <td style="text-align: center">Wayne Rooney</td> <td style="text-align: center">34</td> <td style="text-align: center">53</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> <td style="text-align: center">Michael Owen</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> <td style="text-align: center">40</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">7</td> <td style="text-align: center">Alan Shearer</td> <td style="text-align: center">23</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">8</td> <td style="text-align: center">Tom Finney</td> <td style="text-align: center">23</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">9</td> <td style="text-align: center">Nat Lofthouse</td> <td style="text-align: center">22</td> <td style="text-align: center">30</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">10</td> <td style="text-align: center">Frank Lampard</td> <td style="text-align: center">21</td> <td style="text-align: center">29</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You can see that whilst Kane is still number 1 - his number of goals are significantly less. (Note that the adjusted number of goals here have been rounded to the nearest goal for ease of reading).</p> <p>As may be expected Kane has the biggest change between actual goals scored (69) and the weighted number of goals (45) with a difference of 24, perphaps reaffirming the theory that modern day players are scoring a significant amount of their goals against weaker opposition than in the past. Gary Lineker moves from 4th in the all time list to 2nd.</p> <p>At the other end of the table we end up with a number of people (41) who (because of the rounding as well) move from having scored at least 1 for England to being on 0 goals, but only four who go from more than 1 to zero:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Goals</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Tammy Abraham</td> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Paul Ince</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">Tyrone Mings</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">James Ward-Prowse</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">0</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Unfortuntaely Tammy Abraham’s 3 goals for England were scored against very much weaker opposition in the form of Montenegro (England won 7-0 on 14/11/19), Andorra (England won 0-5 on 09/10/21) and San Marino (England won 0-10 on 15/11/21).</p> <p>If you want to have a look at the data you can access it all <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/assets/files/england_elo_goal_data.csv">here</a>) (which also includes the “Adjusted Total” which weights Friendlies as 0.5 and “finals” as 2x (as per the description <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2015/Rooney-50/">here</a>.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="football"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[By weighting international goals by strength of the opposition we can compare goal scoring prowess across the decades.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Unblock IP address from connecting via SSH</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/Unblock_IP_on_Linux/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Unblock IP address from connecting via SSH"/><published>2018-03-08T11:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-03-08T11:46:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/Unblock_IP_on_Linux</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2018/Unblock_IP_on_Linux/"><![CDATA[<p>I manage a small cluster at work and occasionally students get their IP address banned by entering the wrong password when logging into the cluster.

Each team has been allocated a pot (1 to 4) based on “sporting principles”. The FIFA World Rankings (as of October 2017) were used to rank the teams in descending order (after Russia, who, as hosts, are the top seeds). The pots are:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 1</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 2</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 3</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Pot 4</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Russia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Spain</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Denmark</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Serbia</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Germany</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Peru</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Iceland</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Nigeria</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Brazil</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Switzerland</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Costa Rica</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Australia</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Portugal</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">England</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Sweden</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Japan</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Argentina</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Colombia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Tunisia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Morocco</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Belgium</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Mexico</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Egypt</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Panama</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Poland</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Uruguay</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Senegal</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Korea Republic</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">France</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Croatia</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Iran</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Saudi Arabia</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The exact rules for the draw are <a href="http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2017/m=11/news=close-up-on-final-draw-procedures-2921440.html?intcmp=fifacom_hp_module_news_top">described here</a> (with a handy video explanation). Roughly speaking the rules are that, after Russia, who will definitely be assigned to Group A, a random team from each pot will be drawn, and then placed in the next available group (alphabetically) which they are allowed to be put in (subject to constraints such as splitting up the confederation). This process is repeated until all teams have been drawn.</p> <p>However, because of the rules of splitting confederations, each permutation of the 4 pots is not actually possible. So if you focus on one team you can look at what the probabilities of drawing other teams are.

The idea being that the prices may be correlated with population density.</p> <p>Exactly how car insurers create their prices is not clear. But there is plenty of discussion online that it is, at least in part, related to your postcode. Many explain this relationship between price and postcode as being down to the crime rate in the area. However one of the PhD students in my office (Steve) said that it was to do with population density in the individual postcodes (the basic idea being more people = more accidents). Indeed, it has already been <a href="https://crimesciencejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40163-021-00155-8">shown</a> that crime rate is correlated to population density. So showing a relationship between car insurance categories and population density, also shows a correlation between the categories and crime rate (as the online discussion suggests). So this all seemed like an interesting thought and so I went online and grabbed some data.</p> <p>The car insurance prices are split into 7 categories (‘A’ – ‘F’ and ‘Refer’) from <a href="https://www.theclayclothcompany.co.uk/blogs/motoring/car-insurance-postcodes">here</a> (with original data from motorcarinsuranceuk.co.uk which is no longer availablle). The site mentioned that the data is as “accurate as far as we know but there could be slight differences”. ‘A’ is a ‘good postcode / low risk’ and ‘Refer’ means that an individual would need to contact the individual car insurers (I take this to mean that ‘Refer’ is worse than an ‘F’). This conveniently gives a breakdown of category by postcode.</p> <p>The population density of each postcode can be found from the Office for National Statistics. Specifically from table <a href="https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/census/2011/qs102ew">QS102EW</a>.</p> <p>Creating a box plot (including the mean) of the data (insurance category against population density) shows that there is a correlation between population density and car insurance category as Steve expected.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/popDen_carInsur-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/popDen_carInsur-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/popDen_carInsur-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/popDen_carInsur.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The lower the population density the better category car insurance you can get.</p> <p>The plot was created using the <a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn: statistical data visualization</a> package.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="internet"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is the price of car insurance correlated with where you live?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Number of Unique Song Choices on Desert Island Discs</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2017/Unique_DID/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Number of Unique Song Choices on Desert Island Discs"/><published>2017-01-29T11:34:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-01-29T11:34:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2017/Unique_DID</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2017/Unique_DID/"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qnmr">Desert Island Discs</a> celebrates its 75th birthday today, and today’s guest is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08bz0rz">David Beckham</a>. Beckham will pick 8 song choices to take away with him on a desert island. What I wondered was, will all of his song choices have been picked by guests previously? With over 3,000 episodes there are going to be a lot of repetitions.</p> <p>Obviously the very first guest, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0nq">Vic Oliver</a> had to pick 8 unique song choices. There was no one before him! The second guest, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0nl">James Agate</a> also picked 8 unique choices (they were all different to Vic Oliver’s). This continued until the 8th guest, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0my">Joan Jay</a>, who only had 7 unique choices (she picked Ave Maria by Charles‐François Gounod the same as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009y0n8">Pat Kirkwood</a>). A quick scrape of the BBC 4 webpage gives us all of the song choices of each of the guests. Plotting the data as a histogram of ‘unique’ choices leads to a not unsurprising result:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/did1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/did1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/did1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/did1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>On average a castaway picks 3 unique choices, but really anything between 2 and 5 unique choices is quite probable. Picking 0 unique choices (~100 out of 3096 castaways) and all (8) unique choices (~50 out of 3096 castaways) is not very likely. The thing that is rather interesting though is if you look at the number of unique choices as a time series:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/did2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/did2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/did2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/did2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The data is obviously very noisy, with 0 and 8 unique choices scattered throughout the time series. But there is a clear trend. I’ve fitted a curve (least-squares) to the data and the results hopefully become clear. There was a decrease in the number of unique choices from the start of the show down until the mid 1980s, and since then there has been an increase again! I would guess that this has something to do with the explosion of popular music, the early choices are dominated by “famous” classical music pieces, but this has decreased over time.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="internet"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many unique song choices to guests pick on Desert Island Discs?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Number of days until first Premier League manager sacking</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2016/Prem_Sackings/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Number of days until first Premier League manager sacking"/><published>2016-10-03T18:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-03T18:27:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2016/Prem_Sackings</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2016/Prem_Sackings/"><![CDATA[<p>I’ll get straight to the point, on average the first Premier League manager is sacked after 77 days.</p> <p>Following the sacking of Francesco Guidolin from Swansea City today (52 days into the season), I wondered how long into the season the first manager is sacked on average.

Once you’ve got those, you can also determine tangent, cosecant, secant, and cotangent values.</p> <p>Often, students need to know the sine and cosine values of the most common angles: $0$, $\frac{\pi}{6}$, $\frac{\pi}{4}$, $\frac{\pi}{3}$, and $\frac{\pi}{2}$ (or 0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, and 90°). Fortunately, it’s remarkably easy to work these out.</p> <p>First, write down the angles we are looking for:</p> \[\begin{array}{cccccc} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\pi}{6} &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} &amp; \frac{\pi}{3} &amp; \frac{\pi}{2} \\ &amp; 0^\circ &amp; 30^\circ &amp; 45^\circ &amp; 60^\circ &amp; 90^\circ \\ \hline \end{array}\] <p>To determine the sine values, write down the digits 0 to 4:</p> \[\begin{array}{cccccc} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\pi}{6} &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} &amp; \frac{\pi}{3} &amp; \frac{\pi}{2} \\ &amp; 0^\circ &amp; 30^\circ &amp; 45^\circ &amp; 60^\circ &amp; 90^\circ \\ \hline \sin &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4 \\ \end{array}\] <p>Next, take the square root of each of those numbers:</p> \[\begin{array}{cccccc} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\pi}{6} &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} &amp; \frac{\pi}{3} &amp; \frac{\pi}{2} \\ &amp; 0^\circ &amp; 30^\circ &amp; 45^\circ &amp; 60^\circ &amp; 90^\circ \\ \hline \sin &amp; \sqrt{0} &amp; \sqrt{1} &amp; \sqrt{2} &amp; \sqrt{3} &amp; \sqrt{4} \\ \end{array}\] <p>Then, divide each by 2:</p> \[\begin{array}{cccccc} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\pi}{6} &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} &amp; \frac{\pi}{3} &amp; \frac{\pi}{2} \\ &amp; 0^\circ &amp; 30^\circ &amp; 45^\circ &amp; 60^\circ &amp; 90^\circ \\ \hline \sin &amp; \frac{\sqrt{0}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{1}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{4}}{2} \\ \end{array}\] <p>Simplifying these terms:</p> \[\begin{array}{cccccc} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\pi}{6} &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} &amp; \frac{\pi}{3} &amp; \frac{\pi}{2} \\ &amp; 0^\circ &amp; 30^\circ &amp; 45^\circ &amp; 60^\circ &amp; 90^\circ \\ \hline \sin &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; 1 \\ \end{array}\] <p>To find the cosine values, write the numbers from 4 down to 0, then take the square root of each and divide by 2:</p> \[\begin{array}{cccccc} &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{\pi}{6} &amp; \frac{\pi}{4} &amp; \frac{\pi}{3} &amp; \frac{\pi}{2} \\ &amp; 0^\circ &amp; 30^\circ &amp; 45^\circ &amp; 60^\circ &amp; 90^\circ \\ \hline \sin &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; 1 \\ \cos &amp; 1 &amp; \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} &amp; \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; 0 \\ \end{array}\] <p>Using these values and basic trigonometric identities, you can find all other trigonometric functions.

Similarly, Conrad and Bean were on Apollo 12 (though I couldn’t recall the third crew member at that moment). I also remembered Lovell and Haise from Apollo 13, Shepard from Apollo 14, and Young from Apollo 16. This led me to consider that alphabetical order might have ‘influenced’ crew assignments.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/apollo_az-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/apollo_az-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/apollo_az-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/apollo_az" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Hey look! Clearly the order was, at least partially, determined alphabetically.</p> <p>Or perhaps not? This observation brings us to the topic of confidence intervals, which are crucial in statistical analysis. While strong correlations can be found between various factors, this doesn’t necessarily imply causation. For instance, there’s a 0.985 correlation between arcade revenue and computer science doctorates awarded in the U.S. (More examples can be found at <a href="https://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations</a>.)<br/> Even ignoring causation, one thing we should consider is the confidence interval of our correlation.</p> <p>Confidence intervals indicate the reliability of a statistical measure; more data typically leads to greater trust in the result. These intervals are often specified at levels like 95% or 99%.</p> <p>Let’s examine a simple example, calculating a 95% confidence interval for a percentage:</p> <p>A TV advertisement claimed that a certain hair conditioner is the nation’s favorite, with small print stating, “73% of 64 people asked agreed.” This means 47 people concurred (0.73 × 64 ≈ 47). A larger sample size would provide more confidence in this claim. However, we can use the confidence interval to assess the statistical significance of 73% from a sample of 64. The formula for a 95% confidence interval of a percentage is:</p> \[95\text{\%} \text{ C.I.} = \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\] <p>where $p$ is the percentage (as a decimal) and $n$ is the sample size. Applying our numbers:</p> \[\begin{align*} 95\text{\% C.I.} &amp;= \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.73 \times 0.27}{64}} \\ &amp;= \pm 10.9 \end{align*}\] <p>This results in a 95% confidence interval of approximately $\pm$11%, indicating that the true percentage likely falls between 62% and 84%.

A lot of discussion has therefore been about if he is the greatest English attacker of all time or not. Let’s look at the data.</p> <p>The main argument against Rooney being the greatest is his lack of World Cup Finals goals (1; at the 2014 finals). A comment which is also often made is about the number of “friendly” goals scored. Lineker (with a total of 48 goals for England, 3rd in the all time list) was recently voted as England’s greatest attacker in a BBC poll, managed 10 goals in World Cup finals (including the 1986 Golden Boot).</p> <p>So what if we weight goals differently? What if we make friendly goals worth 0.5 a goal, and “finals” goals (i.e. the World Cup Finals and European Championships Finals) as times 2? What does that do to the all time scoring list?</p> <p>(Here I count goals in the old “Home Championship” as ‘1’ (i.e. the same as World Cup and European qualifiers). Although there is an argument to be had that it should be weighted more heavily since it was <strong>the</strong> international competition for England before the World Cup got “big” (~pre-1950s). However, for now I’ll leave its weighting as ‘1’.)</p> <p>In that adjusted table we get the following:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Ranking</th> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">Wayne Rooney</td> <td style="text-align: center">49</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gary Lineker</td> <td style="text-align: center">46</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">Bobby Charlton</td> <td style="text-align: center">43</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td style="text-align: center">Michael Owen</td> <td style="text-align: center">39</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5</td> <td style="text-align: center">Jimmy Greaves</td> <td style="text-align: center">34.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5</td> <td style="text-align: center">Alan Shearer</td> <td style="text-align: center">34. 5</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>You can see that Rooney is still number 1 - despite down weighting the friendly goals.</p> <p>But okay, perhaps you think friendlies shouldn’t count at all and only competitive fixtures should be counted (the ‘Adjusted Goals’ column is if we again weight finals goals more heavily, the first ranking column is for the ‘non-adjusted’ goals):</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Ranking</th> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Goals</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Goals</th> <th style="text-align: center">Adjusted Ranking</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">Wayne Rooney</td> <td style="text-align: center">36</td> <td style="text-align: center">42</td> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">Stephen Bloomer</td> <td style="text-align: center">28</td> <td style="text-align: center">28</td> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">Bobby Charlton</td> <td style="text-align: center">27</td> <td style="text-align: center">32</td> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td style="text-align: center">Michael Owen</td> <td style="text-align: center">26</td> <td style="text-align: center">32</td> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gary Lineker</td> <td style="text-align: center">24</td> <td style="text-align: center">34</td> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> <td style="text-align: center">Jimmy Greaves</td> <td style="text-align: center">23</td> <td style="text-align: center">24</td> <td style="text-align: center">8</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Again, Rooney comes top for both the usual and adjusted goal tallies. (One way) to knock Rooney off that top spot (if you particularly want to for some reason) is to look at the ‘goals per cap ratio’. To use this stat we have to set a cap limit because of the people who didn’t play very much. For example, Albert Allen, Francis Bradshaw, John Veitch, John Yates and Rev. Walter Gilliat who were all capped once by England, and each scored a hattrick on their one, and only, appearance for England. This gives them a rather impressive 3 goals per cap ratio. If we only consider players who have at least 40 caps then:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th style="text-align: center">Ranking</th> <th style="text-align: center">Name</th> <th style="text-align: center">Goals per cap</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">1</td> <td style="text-align: center">Jimmy Greaves</td> <td style="text-align: center">0.77</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">2</td> <td style="text-align: center">Gary Lineker</td> <td style="text-align: center">0.6</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">3</td> <td style="text-align: center">Peter Crouch</td> <td style="text-align: center">0.52</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">4</td> <td style="text-align: center">Geoff Hurst</td> <td style="text-align: center">0.49</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">5</td> <td style="text-align: center">Alan Shearer</td> <td style="text-align: center">0.48</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="text-align: center">6</td> <td style="text-align: center">Wayne Rooney</td> <td style="text-align: center">0.47</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Finally, if you again weighted the goals (since Crouch scored 12 of his 22 goals in friendlies) you would find the order is Greaves, Lineker, Hurst, Shearer, Rooney (Crouch drops from 3rd to 8th).</p> <p>I am not going to make any conclusions about if Rooney is England’s greatest attacker or not, that is up to you! All the data I’ve used in this post was collected from <a href="https://www.englandstats.com/">englandstats.com</a> and is accurate as of today (11th September, 2015). If you want to play around with the data I’ve collated all the stats (player names, caps, minutes played and goals scored (separated into individual competitions)) into an Excel file available <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/assets/files/england_goal_data_2015_09_11.xlsx">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="update">Update</h2> <p>An updated data file, as of 2024-11-20, is available <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/assets/files/england_goal_data.csv">here</a>. This includes an ‘Adjusted Total’ column which, as above, weights friendly goals as 0.5 and “finals” goals (i.e. the World Cup Finals and European Championships Finals) by a factor of 2.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="football"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Data analysis of Wayne Rooney's 50 goals for England]]></summary></entry></feed>
