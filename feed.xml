Modern players are scoring at unprecedented rates, and while this is undoubtedly exciting for fans, it raises an important question: Are today’s goal-scoring feats truly comparable to those of past legends?</p> <p>The landscape of international football has evolved significantly. The expansion of FIFA membership has introduced many new, smaller nations into the competitive arena. This influx has led to more matches where traditional football powerhouses face off against developing teams, often resulting in lopsided scorelines. Consequently, contemporary players have more opportunities to inflate their goal tallies against weaker opposition.</p> <p>This shift poses a challenge when attempting to compare the goal-scoring records of current players with those from previous eras. The legends of the past often played fewer matches against a more consistent level of competition, making their goal tallies a reflection of performances against relatively equal opponents.</p> <p>So, how can we level the playing field and make fair comparisons across different football eras?</p> <h2 id="introducing-a-weighted-goal-system">Introducing a Weighted Goal System</h2> <p>To address this disparity, I embarked on a project to adjust goal records by accounting for the relative strength of the opposition. The idea is to assign a weighting to each goal based on the difficulty of scoring against a particular team at the time of the match. This method aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of a player’s goal-scoring achievements.</p> <h3 id="utilizing-elo-ratings">Utilizing Elo Ratings</h3> <p>The foundation of this approach lies in the Elo rating system, a method originally devised for ranking chess players but now widely adopted across various sports, including football. Elo ratings provide a dynamic measure of a team’s strength, updating after each match based on the result and the quality of the opposition.</p> <p>By leveraging historical Elo ratings, we can assess the relative strength of any two teams at the time they played. This allows us to calculate a weighting factor for each goal scored, reflecting the challenge posed by the opponent.</p> <h3 id="the-weighting-formula">The Weighting Formula</h3> <p>The weighting for each goal is determined using the following formula:</p> \[\text{Weight} = 1 - k\times\frac{E-O}{E}\] <p>Where, \(E\) is the Elo rating of England before the match, \(O\) is the Elo rating of the opposition before the match and \(k\) a scaling constant that adjusts the sensitivity of the weighting to the difference in Elo ratings.</p> <p>This formula adjusts the weight of a goal based on how much stronger or weaker the opposition is relative to England:</p> <ul> <li>If England faces a stronger team (\(O &gt; E\)), the weighting increases above 1, acknowledging the greater difficulty.</li> <li>If England faces a weaker team (\(O &lt; E\)), the weighting decreases below 1, reflecting the relatively easier challenge.</li> <li>The constant \(k\) controls how much the difference in ratings affects the weighting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="interpreting-the-weighting">Interpreting the Weighting</h3> <p>Adjusting the \(k\) value alters the impact of the opposition’s strength:</p> <ul> <li>A higher \(k\) value (e.g., 2) amplifies the effect, giving more weight to goals against stronger teams and less to those against weaker ones.</li> <li>A lower \(k\) value (e.g., 1) minimizes the effect, resulting in a more uniform weighting across different opponents.</li> </ul> <p>By experimenting with different \(k\) values, we can fine-tune the system to balance fairness and sensitivity, ensuring that exceptional performances against top-tier teams are appropriately recognized while maintaining a reasonable value for consistent scoring against all opponents.</p> <p>For the rest of this post we use a value of \(k=2\).</p> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>When I last wrote a post similar to this, Wayne Rooney had just <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2015/Rooney-50/">broke the England National team goal record with 50 goals</a>. Since then Kane has broke this record again (at the time of writing) with 69 goals. Using the above approach the updated top 10 of England goal scorers are (the “Ranking” is based on the weighted goals column):</p> <style>table{border-collapse:collapse;width:50%;margin:20px auto}th,td{border:1px solid black;padding:8px;text-align:left}th{cursor:pointer;background-color:#f4f4f4}</style> <table id="footballTable"> <thead> <tr> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 0)">Ranking</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 1)">Name</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 2)">Goals</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 3)">Weighted Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Harry Kane</td> <td>69</td> <td>45</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Gary Lineker</td> <td>48</td> <td>37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Bobby Charlton</td> <td>49</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Jimmy Greaves</td> <td>44</td> <td>35</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Wayne Rooney</td> <td>53</td> <td>34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Michael Owen</td> <td>40</td> <td>30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Alan Shearer</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Tom Finney</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Nat Lofthouse</td> <td>30</td> <td>22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Frank Lampard</td> <td>29</td> <td>21</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <script>function sortTable(e,r){const s=document.getElementById(e),t=Array.from(s.rows).slice(1),n=!isNaN(t[0].cells[r].innerText);let o=t.sort((e,s)=>{return(n?+e.cells[r].innerText:e.cells[r].innerText.toLowerCase())>(n?+s.cells[r].innerText:s.cells[r].innerText.toLowerCase())?1:-1});const c="asc"===s.dataset.sortOrder?"desc":"asc";"desc"===c&&o.reverse(),s.dataset.sortOrder=c,o.forEach(e=>s.tBodies[0].appendChild(e))}</script> <p>You can see that whilst Kane is still number 1 - his number of goals are significantly less. (Note that the adjusted number of goals here have been rounded to the nearest goal for ease of reading).</p> <p>As may be expected Kane has the biggest change between actual goals scored (69) and the weighted number of goals (45) with a difference of 24, perphaps reaffirming the theory that modern day players are scoring a significant amount of their goals against weaker opposition than in the past. Gary Lineker moves from 4th in the all time list to 2nd.</p> <p>At the other end of the table we end up with a number of people (41) who (because of the rounding as well) move from having scored at least 1 for England to being on 0 goals, but only four who go from more than 1 to zero:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black;

xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Solar_storms_are_like_buses/"><![CDATA[<p>This was the second time this year they have been broadly visible across the UK, with the last major display occurring on the evening of May 10th, 2024. For many, seeing these incredible lights twice in a single year is almost unheard of, and for good reason: before 2024, the UK hadn’t experienced a space weather event of these magnitudes, in over two decades.</p> <p>What has caused this sudden surge in activity? The answer lies in the Sun’s solar cycle, which is rapidly approaching the peak of its activity, and, just like waiting for a bus, after 20 years of relative calm, the UK has now seen two major solar storms in the space of six months.</p> <h2 id="solar-maximum-the-driver-behind-the-lights">Solar Maximum: The Driver Behind the Lights</h2> <p>At the heart of this increased auroral activity is the Sun itself. The Sun goes through cycles of roughly 11 years, moving from periods of quiet (solar minimum) to periods of high activity (solar maximum). We’re currently approaching solar maximum, and this is why we’re seeing more frequent and powerful solar storms.</p> <p>These storms occur when the Sun releases huge quantities matter and magnetic field in the form of a coronal mass ejection (CME) which are also very often associated with solar flares. When these high-speed and high-energy CMEs reach Earth, they can interact and disturb our planet’s magnetic field, causing the stunning lights of the aurora. During solar maximum, the Sun produces more of these storms, leading to auroras that are brighter, more widespread, and visible at lower latitudes—like the UK.</p> <h2 id="what-makes-these-storms-so-special">What Makes These Storms So Special?</h2> <p>Solar storms are typically classified according to the NOAA Space Weather Scale which, for geomagnetic storms, run from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme), whilst the storm back in May was classified as a G5 (extreme) storm last night the storm peaked at a G4 (severe) event. For context, the last time the UK saw storms of this ‘size’ was over 20 years ago, in October 2003.</p> <p>What makes these storms particularly fascinating is that they push the auroral oval, the region around the poles where the Northern Lights occur, further south. Normally, the UK is too far from the poles to regularly see auroras, but during a G4 or G5 storm, the lights can be visible much further south than the usually are.</p> <h2 id="the-smartphone-effect">The Smartphone Effect</h2> <p>However this was still a relatively mild storm, and can be expected to occur on average about once every 3 or 4 years. One thing that has been particularly different this time around (for both last night and the storm in May), however, is the number of pictures flooding social media. Thanks to the widespread use of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras, capturing the aurora has never been easier. Modern smartphones now have the ability to take long-exposure shots, which allows them to capture the faint light of the aurora in ways the naked eye cannot. As a result, these natural light shows are being documented and shared like never before, over the coming months and year it may make it feel as if the auroras are more frequent than they might have seemed during previous solar cycles.</p> <h2 id="serene-understanding-space-weather">SERENE: Understanding Space Weather</h2> <p>While the visual spectacle of an aurora is captivating, there’s serious science behind these storms. The Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) group at the University of Birmingham is at the forefront of research into space weather and its effects on Earth. As a world-class research team, SERENE focuses on understanding the impacts of solar storms and helping society prepare for the disruptions they can cause.</p> <p>Space weather doesn’t just create auroras; it can also affect critical systems such as communications, GPS, satellite orbits and even the power grid. SERENE’s work is vital for mitigating the risks posed by these powerful geomagnetic storms. Their research is ensuring that as we enjoy the beauty of the Northern Lights, we’re also better equipped to protect the technology that supports modern life.</p> <blockquote> <p>Thanks to research groups like SERENE, we can enjoy the beauty of the aurora with the peace of mind that we’re ready for whatever space weather may bring. Prof. Sean Elvidge, Professor in Space Environment, in the Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) group</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="looking-ahead-more-auroras-to-come">Looking Ahead: More Auroras to Come?</h2> <p>As we approach the peak of the solar cycle, we can expect more opportunities to witness auroras in the UK. Solar storms will continue to erupt from the Sun and head toward Earth, and if the conditions are right (including cloud-free skies!), we could see even more stunning displays over the next couple of years. For those eager to catch the lights, staying tuned to space weather forecasts during this period of increased activity is key.</p> <p>The next time you see those vibrant reds and greens shimmering in the night sky, you’ll know that it’s not just a stroke of luck - it’s the Sun, cycling through its periodic bursts of activity. And thanks to research groups like SERENE, we can enjoy the beauty of the aurora with the peace of mind that we’re ready for whatever space weather may bring.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, across much of the world including the UK, the majestic aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, were once again visible to us.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Rules of Acquisition</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Rules_of_Acquisition/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rules of Acquisition"/><published>2024-09-21T06:44:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-21T06:44:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Rules_of_Acquisition</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2024/Rules_of_Acquisition/"><![CDATA[<p>I am a big Star Trek fan and also have been enjoying the recent explosion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="\_blank">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a>, so I thought I would come up with a way they could be combined.</p> <p>The ‘Rules of Acquisition’ are a collection of sayings of which the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi" target="\_blank">Ferengi</a> society is based:</p> <blockquote> <p>Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by these rules to ensure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned.<br/> (DS9: “The Maquis, Part I”)</p> </blockquote> <p>According to various sources, by the mid-22nd century there were 173 rules (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Acquisition_(episode)" target="\_blank">ENT: “Acquisition”</a>), by the 2370s there were 285 (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition_(episode)" target="\_blank">DS9: “Rules of Acquisition”</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Parts_(episode)" target="\_blank">“Body Parts”</a>; <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/False_Profits_(episode)" target="\_blank">VOY: “False Profits”</a>), and 289 by the 2380s (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Friends,_New_Planets_(episode)" target="\_blank">LD: “Old Friends, New Planets”</a>).</p> <p>The exact rules appear fairly randomly throughout the Star Trek canon, scattered throughout a number of episodes (predominatly in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" target="\_blank">Star Trek Deep Space 9</a>). Two excellent wikis exist to document the vast Star Trek universe, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Main" target="\_blank">Memory Alpha</a> (using information from all released television series and feature films) and <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="\_blank">Memory Beta</a> (using information from all TV, films and licensed Star Trek works, including novels, comic books, RPG sourcebooks, video games and any other licensed works).</p> <p>In the “primary” canon, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank">52 of the 289 rules were defined</a> and in the extended canon <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi_Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank">144 of the 285 rules were defined</a> (although Rule #2 is defined twice, in different ways).</p> <p>In September 2024 OpenAI released their <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="\_blank">“o1-preview” model</a> which were “trained to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes”. It seems like a very powerful model so I decided to put it to the test…</p> <p>I feed it the complete biographical information of the Ferengi’s, their biology, psychology (greed and self preservation), societal information and culture (profit and loss, beliefs, rituals and diplomacy) which are well defined, and referenced <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi" target="\_blank">here</a>. Along with that I provided the 144 existing rules from the wider canon and asked it to fill in the missing rules.</p> <p>And what a wonderful job it did! The complete list is below, merging the ChatGPT-derived rules along with the existing canon (with those by ChatGPT clearly highlighted) but some of my favourites it came up with are:</p> <p>#12 “Anything worth doing is worth doing for profit.”</p> <p>#24: “Never mix business with pleasure unless it enhances profit.”</p> <p>#28: “Morality is always negotiable in the pursuit of profit.”</p> <p>#80: “If it works, sell it; if it doesn’t, sell it as an antique.”</p> <p>#96: “For every opportunity, there’s an equal and opposite opportunity—exploit both.”</p> <p>#114: “The small print holds the biggest profits.”</p> <p>#132: “A lie isn’t a lie until someone else knows the truth.”</p> <p>#161: “Never work for free, unless there’s future profit.”</p> <h2 id="complete-list-of-the-rules-of-acquisition">Complete List of the Rules of Acquisition</h2> <p>Note: if the source is not ChatGPT then these rules come from the <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi_Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank">Ferengi Rules of Acquisition by Memory Beta</a>, which contains more details including links to the source material/epsiode guide.</p> <table border="1" class="dataframe"> <thead> <tr style="text-align: left;"> <th>Rule Number</th> <th>Rule</th> <th>Source</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Once you have their money... you never give it back.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Nagus", PRD episode: "First Con-tact"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Money is everything.</td> <td>ST - Strange New Worlds 9 short story: "The Last Tree on Ferenginar: A Ferengi Fable From the Future"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Maquis, Part II"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Sedition and treason are always profitable.</td> <td>ST video game: Star Trek Online</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Always exaggerate your estimates.</td> <td>SCE eBook: Cold Fusion</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Never allow family law stand in the way of opportunity.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Nagus"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Keep your ears open.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "In the Hands of the Prophets"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Small print leads to large risk.</td> <td>DS9 reference: The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Opportunity plus instinct equals profit.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Storyteller"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Greed is eternal.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Prophet Motive"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>Opportunity waits for no one—seize it quickly.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12</td> <td>Anything worth doing is worth doing for profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13</td> <td>Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>14</td> <td>Sometimes the quickest way to find profits is to let them find you.</td> <td>Fortune of War (TTN novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15</td> <td>Dead men close no deals.</td> <td>Demons of Air and Darkness (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>A deal is a deal... until a better one comes along.</td> <td>The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition (DS9 reference book)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17</td> <td>A contract is a contract is a contract... but only between Ferengi</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Body Parts"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>18</td> <td>A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Heart of Stone", DS9 - The Dog of War comic: "Issue 3"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>19</td> <td>Satisfaction is not guaranteed.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>He who dives under the table today lives to profit tomorrow.</td> <td>Ferenginar: Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed (DS9 novella)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21</td> <td>Never place friendship above profit.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Rules of Acquisition", PRD episode: "First Con-tact"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>22</td> <td>A wise man can hear profit in the wind.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Rules of Acquisition"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23</td> <td>Nothing is more important than your health... except for your money.</td> <td>ENT episode: "Acquisition"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24</td> <td>Never mix business with pleasure unless it enhances profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>25</td> <td>There's no profit in altruism.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>26</td> <td>Customers are like latinum; treasure them and they'll return.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>27</td> <td>There's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>28</td> <td>Morality is always negotiable in the pursuit of profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29</td> <td>What's in it for me?</td> <td>Highest Score (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30</td> <td>"Confidentiality equals profit."</td> <td>DS9 - The Badlands novel: Part IV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>31</td> <td>Never make fun of a Ferengi's mother.

The product of a large solar storm, curtains of green, red and purple light rippled across the night sky in regions where the spectacle is seldom seen. I saw them for the first time in the United Kingdom, from my back garden just outside Birmingham. More displays are expected in the coming months as solar activity starts to reach its peak.</p> <p>But what most people didn’t see were the repercussions — and the preparations that went on behind the scenes to mitigate them. Radio communications systems experienced blackouts; Starlink, the satellite Internet provider, faced outages; and disruptions to global navigation satellite systems caused problems for sectors reliant on positioning. Meanwhile, flights were re-routed and electric grids were safeguarded.</p> <p>This illustrates a dilemma faced by space-weather scientists such as myself: how can we issue and communicate effective warnings when even such a significant storm changes little in most people’s lives? I think part of the problem lies in how we classify space weather. Current systems are simplistic; space weather is not.</p> <p>Geomagnetic storms are classified using scales developed by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in collaboration with the space-weather community. The geomagnetic storm scale (G-scale), solar radiation storm scale (S-scale) and radio blackout scale (R-scale) range from one to five, with five denoting an extreme event.</p> <p>These scales have been invaluable in highlighting the risk of space weather to industries and governments, but they are due a refresh. The geomagnetic storm that caused the May auroras was classified as G5, or ‘extreme’. However, the effects of a solar storm are challenging to quantify. This storm was triggered by a rapid sequence of at least seven coronal mass ejections — massive bursts of solar matter and magnetic fields expelled from the surface of the Sun. As these collided with Earth’s magnetic field, they compressed and disturbed it, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00007-1" target="\_blank">triggering geomagnetic storms</a>.</p> <p>But many factors, including the speed, mass, duration and magnetic orientation of coronal mass ejections, influence a storm’s impact. In terms of peak geomagnetic activity, the May storm was a 1-in-10-year event. What set this storm apart was its prolonged duration. Geomagnetic disturbances remained high for 24 hours, making it more like a 1-in-75-year event. Auroras were visible for longer, allowing more people to witness them.</p> <p>Such details make it hard to convey the risks of space weather without overstating or understating them. If an event such as that seen in May, deemed ‘extreme’, results in minimal obvious disruption, how should the risks of an even stronger 1-in-100-year storm be conveyed?</p> <p>A superstorm is a looming reality. Costs could reach billions of dollars. Electric grids could be disrupted, causing local blackouts. Satellites, and the essential systems they support, could be impaired. Radio signals, crucial for aviation, maritime operations and emergency services, would be disrupted. For example, in October 2003, geomagnetic storms affected satellite communications, GPS systems and power supplies in Europe, North America and Africa.</p> <p>To communicate the severity of truly extreme storms, scientists need to rethink the classification scales. Some researchers suggest extending severity levels to six and above. Others propose covering more phenomena, including the D-Scale (radiation dose rate) and the T-Scale (radio-wave propagation through Earth’s upper atmosphere).</p> <p>My preferred approach is to shift to a ‘traffic light’ model of warnings for specific sectors. For example, yellow space-weather warnings could alert industries, such as aviation and agriculture, that might be affected by minor geomagnetic storms. An orange warning might require users, such as power grid and radar operators, to consider taking pre-emptive action to protect their services and prepare for interruptions. A red warning would signal that dangerous space weather is expected, with potentially significant impacts requiring immediate action, and power companies, satellite operators and emergency services must implement contingency plans without delay.</p> <p>Such a system would quickly alert those who should be most concerned. It could accommodate uncertainties by allowing for updates and escalations in warnings as data become available. For example, a geomagnetic event might start with a yellow warning (high impact, but unlikely) when a coronal mass ejection is first observed. It could be upgraded to orange or red if the probability of disruption increases with further modelling and data. Its reach could easily be expanded by adding sectors to the warning list.</p> <p>A unified approach to refining space weather reporting and response strategies is crucial, and space weather centres worldwide must come together to discuss and agree on an updated approach. They must ensure that terms such as ‘extreme’ are not misused and that these align with events that truly warrant attention and action, and that industries and the public are adequately prepared for the real risks.</p> <p>As we navigate the peak of the solar cycle, it is important to acknowledge that space weather affects our daily lives. By refining classification and reporting systems, scientists can better align public perception with reality, ensuring that we are neither crying wolf nor caught unprepared.</p> <p>Nature 630, 271 (2024)</p> <p>doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01715-z" target="\_blank">https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01715-z</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Categorizing geomagnetic storms on a scale of one to five leaves no room for once-a-century superstorms]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Maths on a Mug 15</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Maths_on_a_Mug_15/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Maths on a Mug 15"/><published>2023-01-14T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2023-01-14T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Maths_on_a_Mug_15</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2023/Maths_on_a_Mug_15/"><![CDATA[<div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_15.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </figure> </div> </div> <p>This is a “simple” <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/tag/mathsonamug/" target="\_blank">#MathsOnAMug</a>. Simple, but very important. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" target="\_blank">Bayes’ theorem</a>:</p> \[P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)P(B).\] <p>This relates the probability of observing \(A\) given that \(B\) is true where \(A\) and \(B\) are events, we also require that the probability of \(B\) does not equal 0 (i.e. \(P(B)\neq 0\)). It allows us to find the probability of a cause, given an effect.</p> <p>Bayes’ can lead to some surprising, count-intuitive, results. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_House" target="\_blank">Dr. House</a> never thinks his patients have Lupus. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_lupus_erythematosus" target="\_blank">Lupus</a> is a condition where antibodies that are supposed to attack foreign cells to prevent infections instead attack plasma proteins which can lead to blood clots. It is believed that 2% of the population have lupus. Suppose that a test is 98% accurate if a person has the disease and 74% accurate if they do not. Given the 98% accuracy of the test, should House really assume his patient with a positive result doesn’t have Lupus?</p> <p>We can check the probability using Bayes’ theorem. Let L represent Lupus, T the test and 1 and 0 positive/negative respectively (I’ll leave as an exercise to the reader to calculate the individual probabilities):</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} P(L=1|T=1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{P(T=1|L=1)P(L=1)}{P(T=1)},\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{(0.98)(0.02)}{0.0196 + 0.2548},\\ &amp;=&amp; \frac{0.0196}{0.2744},\\ &amp;=&amp; 0.0715 \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So House’s insight is sensible, even given a positive result there is only a 7.14% chance of the person actually having Lupus!</p> <p>How we interpret Bayes’ theorem depends on how we interpret probability, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_probability" target="\_blank">Bayesian</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_probability" target="\_blank">Frequentist</a> interpretation. This is a long running fight in mathematics, and it is worth reading about it to see where you come down on the argument. I’ll leave you with a quote from Savage (<a href="http://www.isbnsearch.org/isbn/0486623491" target="\_blank">1954</a>).</p> <blockquote> <p>It is unanimously agreed that statistics depends somehow on probability.

This then seemed to be a sign of what was to come, the semifinal and final was worse than Lazy for most of the tested models. It made for an exciting tournament but a disaster for predictions!</p> <p>The final performance analysis of the models was:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Model</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Brier Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">HAL 9000</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.586</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Bookies</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.588</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Average</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.609</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">BDC</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.655</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Lazy</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.667</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">SSC</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.728</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Immediate things to note are that HAL won (just)! Clearly that is a great result. It is interesting though that SSC (small “smart” crowd) ended up doing much worse than Lazy, which is terrible! I would have expected that to do much better.</p> <p>The poor performance likely comes from the fact that there were a number of “perfect” wrong answers. By that I mean that the model (my friends) all predicted something would definitely happen (e.g. England to beat Denmark after 90 minutes). That gave it a probability of 100%, when it didn’t happen, the maximum penalty of 2.0 was assigned.</p> <p>Nothing in football is ever going to be 100% certain (the most one sided result that the bookies predicted was a Germany win against Hungary in the group stage [80.7%] – it ended up as a draw!). If we set a rule that SSC can never predict more than an 80% result then the Brier Score drops to 0.627 and ends up beating BDC and Lazy – more like I would have expected! Making SSC’s maximum prediction 60% further drops the Brier Score to 0.577 – making it the winning model! However this is likely because there was a large number of surprising results in the tournament, so this is really only a post-tournament model, and not a fair assessment. Setting the maximum to 80% (matching the Bookies maximum value) seems like a fair compromise though!</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Model</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Brier Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">HAL 9000</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.586</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Bookies</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.588</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Average</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.609</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">SSC</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.627</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">BDC</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.655</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Lazy</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.667</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Overall, a great result for HAL. Also, overall, the model came 3rd in Futbolmetrix’s <a href="https://futbolmetrix.wordpress.com/2021/07/12/euro2020-sophcon-final-results/" target="\_blank">Sophisticated Prediction Contest</a> which I am very happy with.

How well is our model doing? One way to investigate this is by looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score" target="\_BLANK">Brier Score</a> of the model. The Brier score is used to measure the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. Fundamentally it is the mean square error of the forecast and varies from 0 (perfect prediction) to 2. So the lower the score the better. For each result a Brier score is calculated and then an overall score is given to the models by taking the mean value.</p> <p>As a baseline, a simple prediction of 33% for each result (win/draw/loss) gives you a Brier score of 0.666. So we should always be looking to do better than that. Likely the best model of this tournament will be that of the bookies (it usually is!). Our version of the bookies model will be to take the average of a range of bookies (rather than taking any one organisation) which can be found on <a href="http://www.oddsportal.com/" target="\_BLANK">oddsportal.com</a>, these are then converted to a probability.</p> <p>Two final models for comparison come from ‘crowd wisdom’. Firstly from <a href="http://www.sofascore.com/" target="\_BLANK">SofaScore</a>, where people can vote on a particular result (typically over 170,000 people vote on these results). Very little thought is needed, you simply press a button about what result you think is most likely, and this is a “secondary” reason for using the app (it is for finding out sports scores). An alternative crowd model comes from a smaller, “smarter”, crowd.</p> <p>For the Premier League, FA Cup, World Cup and Euro’s my friends and I take part in a prediction competition, we predict the result of every fixture (with a suitably complicated scoring system based on the correct result, goals a team score and goal difference). Looking at these 10 peoples predictions we can assign probabilities based on the results they projected (e.g.if 7 people think “Team A” will win, then we assign a 70% probability).</p> <p>So that rounds off the models we are going to compare:</p> <ul> <li>HAL 9000 (that is the name of my model)</li> <li>Bookies</li> <li>BDC (Big Dumb Crowd)</li> <li>SSC (Small Smart Crowd)</li> <li>Lazy (all results 33%)</li> </ul> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 50%;"> <thead> <tr> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Model</th> <th style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Brier Score</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">HAL 9000</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.522</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">SSC</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.547</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Bookies</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.575</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">BDC</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.663</td> </tr> <tr> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">Lazy</td> <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 8px;">0.667</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Currently HAL is winning with a Brier score of 0.522 and the SSC is also beating the bookies (but we’ve only played 12 of 51 matches so plenty of time for that to change!).

First we assume that we do not allow the trivial answer (e.g. where \(n=m=q=0\)). Then rewrite the equation as:</p> \[2^n+3^m=5^q+1.\] <p>Now \(2^n\) must be even for all values of \(n\), and \(3^m\) must be odd for all values of \(m\). Thus \(2^n+3^m\) is odd for all values of \(n\) and \(m\). Similarly, \(5^q\) is odd for all values of \(q\), thus \(5^q+1\) must be even. Therefore the left hand side of the rewritten equation must be odd, whilst the right hand side must be even. Since this is not possible there are no positive integer solutions.</p> <hr/> <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center;"> <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2020/Maths_on_a_Mug_12/" style="text-decoration: none;">Previous Maths on a Mug</a> <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/blog/2021/Maths_on_a_Mug_14/" style="text-decoration: none;">Next Maths on a Mug</a> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="MathsOnAMug"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry></feed>
