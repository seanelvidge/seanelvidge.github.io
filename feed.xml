The tools will be able to support a wide range of users and ultimately allow people to make informed decisions earlier, being proactive rather than reactive in their response to space weather.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Professor Sean Elvidge, Head of Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) - University of Birmingham</strong></p> <p>Complementing the Met Office’s existing space weather forecasting models, which include predicting the arrival of events from the surface of the Sun, this system introduces new forecasting capability for modelling impacts from space weather on satellites, aviation, communications and services which rely on GNSS.</p> <p>Professor Sean Elvidge, Head of Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) at the University of Birmingham, and the lead developer of the system said: “The deployment of this suite at the UK Met Office is the realization of a 10-year vision of SERENE, to build and deliver a state-of-the-art upper atmosphere modelling capability into operational use.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/aeneas_day_group-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/aeneas_day_group-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/aeneas_day_group-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/aeneas_day_group.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>“The tools will be able to support a wide range of users and ultimately allow people to make informed decisions earlier, being proactive rather than reactive in their response to space weather.”</p> <p>The new suite means that, for the first time, forecasters at the Met Office Space Weather Operations Centre (MOSWOC) will have access to forecast model output on the impacts of space weather on the ionosphere, as well as enhanced modelling of the thermosphere.</p> <blockquote> <p>Once again, cutting-edge British innovation is making a remarkable difference to our daily lives - this time from way up in the atmosphere. This is a really exciting example of how better understanding of what’s happening in space can protect the tech we all rely on, from GPS on our phones to keeping the power grid working.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>UK Science Minister Lord Vallance</strong></p> <p>Met Office Space Weather Manager Simon Machin said: “This delivers a world-leading capability that provides greater confidence and forecasting skill than any models currently in operation anywhere else in the world.</p> <p>“This isn’t just about science - it’s about protecting the systems we rely on every day. From aircraft communications to GPS in your phone, space weather can affect us all.”</p> <p>Science Minister Lord Vallance said: “Once again, cutting-edge British innovation is making a remarkable difference to our daily lives - this time from way up in the atmosphere.</p> <p>“This is a really exciting example of how better understanding of what’s happening in space can protect the tech we all rely on, from GPS on our phones to keeping the power grid working.”</p> <p>The new modelling capability will be able to assimilate near real-time data about the current state of the ionosphere and thermosphere, combine with forecasts of solar activity from the Sun to produce accurate and actionable forecasts of the upper atmosphere. This will help enable service providers to take mitigating actions to prevent impacts from space weather where possible.</p> <p>Professor Farideh Honary from Lancaster University said: “We are happy to see our research being translated into a useful product to be used by industry. The research and modelling led by Lancaster is relevant to the aviation industry and in particular to flights using polar routes which are dependent on high frequency communications.</p> <p>“These flights have significantly increased since their initial opening in the 1990s due to their operational advantages such as reduced flight times and fuel consumption, which translate to cost savings and environmental benefits like lower carbon emissions.”</p> <p>More accurate and precise forecast information will help enable service providers to take mitigating actions to prevent impacts from space weather where possible. One example of this is with users of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as GPS, for positioning or navigational purposes. If they understand that there is likely to be a loss of accuracy in GNSS, they can switch to using other systems.</p> <p>Together, the new modelling suite has been delivered as part of Space Weather Instrumentation, Measurement, Modelling and Risk (SWIMMR) programme, which was funded through the UKRI Strategic Priorities Fund and designed to enhance the UK’s capability for monitoring, modelling and forecasting space weather.</p> <p>Professor Ian McCrea, SWIMMR Programme Lead at STFC RAL Space, said: “These new models represent a significant step forward for the UK’s capacity to model, forecast, and understand key components of our upper atmosphere. By coupling advances in physical modelling with global scale observations, they will enable unparalleled awareness of Earth’s geospatial environment.</p> <p>“The models promise to address a wide range of use cases, ranging from radio communications to the prediction of satellite orbits, and we expect that they will be of great importance to a huge variety of stakeholders. They also provide a clear demonstration of how the collaboration between academics and end users, which SWIMMR has enabled, can benefit members of both communities.”</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[New suite of space weather forecasting models focuses on how space weather can influence the thermosphere and ionosphere here on Earth.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Trend in Taylor Swift’s Mood</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2025/Taylor-Swifts-Mood/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Trend in Taylor Swift’s Mood"/><published>2025-10-04T12:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-04T12:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2025/Taylor-Swifts-Mood</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2025/Taylor-Swifts-Mood/"><![CDATA[<p>Taylor Swift doesn’t just release albums, she releases chapters of her life. From the optimism of <em>Fearless</em> to the bite of <em>Reputation</em>, from the hushed poetry of <em>folklore</em> to the midnight reflections of, well, <em>Midnights</em>. Each album is often thought of as a snapshot of where she was at that moment in time.</p> <p>But can we actually see that story in the music itself? I thought I’d try.</p> <p>The chart below shows an experiment: every dot is a Taylor Swift song, plotted by its “average pitch”. The black line is the overall trend album by album, a kind of data-driven glimpse into her changing musical mood.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/TaylorSwiftMood-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/TaylorSwiftMood-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/TaylorSwiftMood-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/TaylorSwiftMood.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Here’s how it works. Every song can be broken down into thousands of tiny audio frames, and we can estimate the pitch of each. You could then just average all those frames/estimated pitches together, but then you end up something pretty meaningless: a whispered aside would count the same as a belted chorus.</p> <p>Instead, I weighted each frame by its ‘loudness’. Big, bold notes dominate, quiet moments barely move the needle. Mathematically the “weighted average pitch” looks like this:</p> \[M = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_im_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i},\] <p>where \(m_i\) is the pitch of a frame (in MIDI numbers) and \(w_i\) is how loud it was. Here we do this in “MIDI” because it is a musical scale. Every step is a semitone. If we used raw frequency in Hertz the maths would skew towards the low notes in a way that doesn’t really match how we actually hear music.</p> <p>So, if you look at our plot, focusing on the smoothed black line, a story starts to appear:</p> <ul> <li>Early albums like <em>Fearless</em> are higher up the stave, matching the wide-eyed optimism of youth.</li> <li><em>1989</em> soars with big pop anthems.</li> <li>Then comes the brooding dip of <em>Reputation</em>, the fallout years.</li> <li>During lockdown, <em>folklore</em> and <em>evermore</em> settle into quieter, lower ground.</li> <li><em>Midnights</em> stays low, steeped in melancholy.</li> <li>And then <em>The Tortured Poets Department</em> plunges deepest of all.</li> <li>Then finally with <em>The Life of a Showgirl</em>, the line bends upward again (significantly). Happy times have returned.</li> </ul> <p>Obviously this is a very simplistic look at the album, and its emotional impact: lyrics, harmony, production, they all matter. But still, there’s something striking about seeing the arc of her career emerge from the raw numbers. By weighting the most powerful sung moments, we get a sense of where the “centre of gravity” of each album lies.</p> <p>And it turns out that when Taylor sings her life, the data sings it back.</p> <hr/> <p>Note: If you would like to try this yourself (inc. for other artists) <a href="/assets/code/taylor_swift.py">here is the link</a>, to the code I used to make this post. You just need to pass a folder of music files to the code and it will work out the rest for you.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="mathematics"/><category term="code"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Taylor Swift doesn't just release albums, she releases chapters of her life, but can we see that story in the music itself?]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pour Over Brewing Recipe Generator</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2025/Pour_over_brewing_recipe_generator/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pour Over Brewing Recipe Generator"/><published>2025-03-31T18:41:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-03-31T18:41:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2025/Pour_over_brewing_recipe_generator</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2025/Pour_over_brewing_recipe_generator/"><![CDATA[<p>I recently purchased a <a href="https://amzn.to/4j7ni2U">Fellow Aiden Precision Coffee Maker</a> which is a pour over coffee brewer. Able to brew individual cups to whole batches this machine is fantastic, and gives you complete control of the recipe it uses. From the bloom time and temperature to the number of pulses and the ability to control the temperature of each individual pulse.</p> <p>There are a number of default reciepes included and through the <a href="https://fellowproducts.com/pages/fellow-drops">Fellow Drops</a> programme you can get a number of tuned recipes for those coffees. Whilst, at the end of the day, coffee all coems down to personal preference, and any provided reciepe will need fine tuning, there are some fundamentals which provide a good starting point. To try and capture that information I have made the following recipe generator:</p> <p><a href="https://seanelvidge.com/brewcoffee">seanelvidge.com/brewcoffee</a></p> <p>If you visit that page, with the details of the coffee bean you have, you can have a look at what the reciepe generator says you should use. If you would like (a lot) more detail of the decisions that I have made to create the generator then read on.</p> <h1 id="roast-level-adjustments">Roast Level Adjustments</h1> <p>Roast level significantly influences extraction dynamics. Light roasts, dense and less porous, require extended blooming (initial wetting) and multiple pulses of hot water at precise intervals to fully unlock their flavors. Consequently, the recipe defaults for light roasts feature higher bloom ratios and longer bloom times, ensuring sufficient CO₂ release for consistent extraction.</p> <p>Conversely, dark roasts, due to their brittleness and faster extraction tendency, need lower extraction ratios and fewer pulses to avoid bitterness. The recipe parameters for darker roasts emphasize shorter bloom times and higher initial bloom temperatures to develop complexity without over-extraction.</p> <h3 id="specifics">Specifics</h3> <p>Light Roast:</p> <ul> <li>Brew Ratio: Increased to 17 for lighter body.</li> <li>Bloom Ratio: Increased to 3.5 to aid degassing.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Extended to 60 seconds for thorough extraction.</li> <li>Pulse Count: Increased to 6, ensuring complete flavor extraction.</li> </ul> <p>Dark Roast:</p> <ul> <li>Brew Ratio: Reduced to 15 to intensify body and reduce bitterness.</li> <li>Bloom Ratio: Decreased to 1.5 due to easier extraction.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Shortened to 40 seconds to prevent over-extraction.</li> <li>Pulse Count: Reduced to 3, limiting extraction bitterness.</li> </ul> <h1 id="bean-origin-influence">Bean Origin Influence</h1> <p>Beans from different regions exhibit unique physical traits influencing their extraction behavior. East African coffees, typically denser with higher solubility, require gentler bloom phases—lower ratios, shorter times, and reduced temperatures—to mitigate over-extraction and accentuate their bright, vibrant acidity.</p> <p>Latin American coffees often demand a longer bloom and higher temperatures to thoroughly degas and enhance sweetness and body. Indonesian coffees, known for their robust character, are best extracted with moderate bloom parameters that balance intensity with clarity.</p> <h3 id="specifics-1">Specifics</h3> <p>East African (Ethiopia, Kenya, etc.):</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Decreased by 0.5 to minimize over-extraction.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Shortened by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Bloom Temperature: Reduced by 3°C.</li> <li>Pulse Count: Decreased by 1 to control acidity.</li> </ul> <p>Latin American (Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala):</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Increased by 0.5 for effective degassing.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Increased by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Bloom Temperature: Raised by 3°C.</li> <li>Pulse Count: Increased by 1 to promote even extraction.</li> </ul> <p>Indonesian (Sumatra, Java):</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio set to 2.5, Bloom Time standardized at 50 seconds.</li> <li>Pulse Count: Increased by 1 to maximize extraction clarity.</li> </ul> <h1 id="altitude-considerations">Altitude Considerations</h1> <p>High-altitude coffees, denser due to slower maturation, need more aggressive extraction parameters—finer grind, stronger brew ratios, and longer bloom durations—to achieve optimal flavor development. In contrast, lower-altitude beans benefit from coarser grinds and gentler extraction processes to preserve balance and avoid bitterness.</p> <h3 id="specifics-2">Specifics</h3> <p>High Altitude (&gt;1500m):</p> <ul> <li>Brew Ratio: Reduced by 0.5 for stronger extraction.</li> <li>Bloom Ratio: Increased by 0.5 to assist degassing.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Increased by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Grind Size: Finer by 2 increments.</li> </ul> <p>Low Altitude (&lt;1200m):</p> <ul> <li>Brew Ratio: Increased by 0.5 for gentler extraction.</li> <li>Bloom Ratio: Decreased by 0.5.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Reduced by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Grind Size: Coarser by 2 increments.</li> </ul> <h1 id="processing-method-adjustments">Processing Method Adjustments</h1> <p>Processing significantly impacts bean composition. Natural, honey, and anaerobic coffees, rich in sugars, require longer bloom periods and additional pulses to evenly extract these complex flavors. Washed coffees, typically cleaner and less dense, are best brewed with shorter blooms and fewer pulses, maintaining clarity and brightness.</p> <h3 id="specifics-3">Specifics</h3> <p>Natural, Honey, Carbonic, Anaerobic:</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Increased by 0.5 (minimum of 2.5).</li> <li>Bloom Time: Extended by 5 seconds (minimum of 45 seconds).</li> <li>Pulse Count: Increased by 1 to control extraction consistency.</li> </ul> <p>Washed, Double Fermentation, Wet-Hulled:</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Decreased by 0.5.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Reduced by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Pulse Count: Decreased by 1.</li> </ul> <h1 id="freshness-factor">Freshness Factor</h1> <p>The age of roasted coffee profoundly affects extraction due to CO₂ levels. Freshly roasted beans (0-7 days) release considerable CO₂, necessitating increased bloom water ratios, longer bloom times, and finer grinds to ensure thorough extraction without bitterness. Conversely, older beans (&gt;20 days) benefit from shorter blooms, lower temperatures, and coarser grinds to avoid over-extraction and maintain desirable flavors.</p> <h3 id="specifics-4">Specifics</h3> <p>Fresh Coffee (0–7 days):</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Increased by 0.5.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Extended by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Grind Size: Finer by 4 increments.</li> <li>Pulse temperatures decreased by 1°C per pulse to counter CO₂ resistance.</li> </ul> <p>Older Coffee (&gt;20 days):</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Decreased by 0.5.</li> <li>Bloom Time: Reduced by 5 seconds.</li> <li>Grind Size: Coarser by 4 increments.</li> <li>Pulse temperatures increased by 1°C per pulse to improve extraction.</li> </ul> <h1 id="flavor-profile-targeting">Flavor Profile Targeting</h1> <p>Achieving specific tasting notes requires fine-tuning extraction parameters:</p> <ul> <li>Fruity and acidic notes: Higher temperatures and finer grinds enhance bright flavors.</li> <li>Nutty and chocolatey notes: Richer bodies are cultivated through lower brew ratios and coarser grinds.</li> <li>Floral and herbal notes: Delicate aromatics emerge clearly with increased bloom ratios.</li> <li>Sweet and heavy notes: Lower bloom ratios preserve syrupy, sweet profiles.</li> <li>Creamy textures: Lower temperatures ensure smooth, rounded mouthfeels.</li> </ul> <h3 id="specifics-5">Specifics</h3> <p>Fruity/Acidic Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Brew Ratio: Increased by 0.5 for brightness.</li> <li>Bloom Temperature: Raised by 2°C.</li> <li>Grind Size: Finer by 4 increments.</li> </ul> <p>Nutty/Chocolate Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Brew Ratio: Decreased by 0.5 for richer body.</li> <li>Grind Size: Coarser by 2 increments.</li> </ul> <p>Floral/Herbal Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Increased by 0.5 for aromatic extraction.</li> <li>Grind Size: Coarser by 2 increments.</li> </ul> <p>Heavy Sweet Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Ratio: Reduced by 0.5 for syrupy texture.</li> <li>Grind Size: Finer by 2 increments.</li> </ul> <p>Creamy Notes:</p> <ul> <li>Bloom Temperature: Reduced by 2°C to preserve smoothness.</li> </ul> <h1 id="pulse-temperature-profiles">Pulse Temperature Profiles</h1> <p>Dynamic pulse temperatures optimize extraction across roast levels:</p> <ul> <li>Light roasts gradually increase temperature across pulses, enhancing complexity.</li> <li>Medium roasts maintain stable temperatures for balanced extraction.</li> <li>Dark roasts reduce temperatures progressively to avoid bitterness, enhancing depth.</li> </ul> <p>Final pulse temperatures further adjust to emphasize specific tasting notes—higher initial temperatures highlight bright, fruity notes, while lower final temperatures preserve sweetness and depth.</p> <h3 id="specifics-6">Specifics</h3> <p>Light Roasts: Gradually increase temperature from 90°C to 96°C.</p> <p>Medium Roasts: Maintain stable bloom temperature; adjust slightly for anaerobic or carbonic processes.</p> <p>Dark Roasts: Decrease temperature progressively from 91°C to 85°C to minimize bitterness.</p> <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1> <p>The <a href="https://amzn.to/4j7ni2U">Fellow Aiden Precision Coffee Maker</a> is a great coffee brewer, giving you almost complete control of the brewing process.

The roar of the crowd, the familiarity of the pitch, the comfort of the home dressing room – all give the home team an edge. This is particularly true in English football. However, a look at the data spanning over a century of English football reveals an interesting trend: the home advantage is shrinking.</p> <p>Using my database of all English league results since 1888 (available <a href="https://github.com/seanelvidge/England-football-results">here</a>, and described <a href="https://seanelvidge.com/articles/2024/All_England_football_league_results/">here</a>) we can track the Home Win %, Draw %, and Away Win % from 1888 to the present day (at the time of writing, that is halfway through the 2024/2025 season, but the charts in this post should automatically update). The results are pretty clear:</p> <html> <div class="chart-container"> <canvas id="resultsChart"></canvas> </div> <img id="fallbackImage1" src="assets/img/home_advantage_trend_fallback.png" alt="Fallback image for home, draw, away % win" style="display: none; max-width: 100%;"/> <style>.chart-container{position:relative;width:100%;min-height:250px;height:50vh;max-height:80vh}</style> </html> <p>In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, home teams were dominant, boasting win percentages well above 60%. Away wins were a relative rarity, hovering around 20%. But as the decades have progressed, the lines have converged. Home win percentages have steadily declined, dipping towards 40% in recent years, while away wins have climbed, now consistently above 30% and with a clear upwards trajectory.</p> <p>It would be easy to assume that this trend is confined to the top tier of English football, where the largest investments in training facilities, player recruitment, and tactical analysis occur. However, if we look at the home win percentages across all four tiers of English football (where “Tier 1” is the highest tier, currently the Premier League and “Tier 4” is the lowest, EFL League Two) we can see that this is a league-wide phenomenon.</p> <html> <div class="chart-container"> <canvas id="divisionChart"></canvas> </div> <img id="fallbackImage2" src="assets/img/home_advantage_trend_fallback_by_division.png" alt="Fallback image for home win % by division" style="display: none; max-width: 100%;"/> </html> <p>As you can see, the decline in home win percentages is remarkably consistent across all levels of professional English football. While there are some minor variations between divisions, the overall trajectory is the same: downwards. This suggests that the factors driving the change are not unique to the top tier but are systemic throughout the entire football pyramid. Each division shows high home win % at the start of the time series (above 50%), but each division ends up closer to 40% by the end of the series.</p> <p>So, what’s driving this shift away from home dominance? Several factors are likely at play:</p> <ul> <li>Standardization of Playing Conditions: In the early days, pitch conditions varied wildly. Home teams were intimately familiar with their own, often quirky, pitches, giving them a distinct advantage. Over time, regulations and advancements in groundskeeping have led to more standardized, high-quality pitches across the league, leveling the playing field. This impact would be felt across all divisions.</li> <li>Improved Travel and Accommodation: Early football often involved arduous journeys for away teams, leaving them fatigued and less prepared. Modern transportation and improved accommodations have minimized the physical toll of travel, allowing away teams to arrive rested and ready to compete. Again, this is relevant to all levels of the game.</li> <li>Tactical Advancements and Analysis: The modern game is far more tactically sophisticated. Managers and analysts have access to vast amounts of data and video footage, allowing them to dissect opponents’ strengths and weaknesses, regardless of location. Away teams can now better prepare for the specific challenges posed by their opponents and their home stadiums. While the resources may be greater at the top, these advancements have filtered down through the divisions.</li> <li>Professionalization and Fitness: Players today are fitter, faster, and more technically skilled than ever before. This overall increase in athleticism can help away teams better cope with the pressures of playing in hostile environments, a trend seen across the footballing spectrum.</li> </ul> <h2 id="the-future-of-home-advantage">The Future of Home Advantage</h2> <p>Whilst home advantage may not be what it once was, it hasn’t disappeared entirely. The support of the home crowd can still provide a boost, and familiarity with the surroundings can offer a slight edge. However, the trend is undeniable. The gap between home and away performance is narrowing, and the English Football League, across all its divisions, is becoming increasingly competitive on all fronts.</p> <p>If we look to extrapolate the trends in the data we can try and estimate what will happen in the future, fitting lines of best fit to the data we can estimate that home advantage will stick around for quite a while yet!</p>

But did you know that your altitude can significantly impact your brew? This post is inspired by my new <a href="https://amzn.to/4j7ni2U">Fellows Aiden Precision Coffee Maker</a> which, on one of the first set up screens asks:</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/fellows_coffee-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/fellows_coffee-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/fellows_coffee-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/fellows_coffee.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Perhaps that seems like an odd question, buf if you’ve ever tried recreating your favourite <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/8kBMHJEUhXWF1KvL9">Birmingham</a> coffee experience in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rfqUP96D2L4juCtT9">Boulder, Colorado</a> (which I have, many times!), you might have noticed something’s a bit “off”. Let’s dive into the science behind why:</p> <p>It all boils down to atmospheric pressure. The air around us exerts pressure, and this pressure decreases as we go higher in altitude. Why? Essentially, there’s less atmosphere above you pushing down.</p> <p>Water boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of the water (or really any liquid) equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. So these changes in atmospheric pressure directly affects the boiling point of water. Lower atmospheric pressure at higher altitudes means water boils at a lower temperature.</p> <p>The relationship between pressure (P) and boiling point (T) can be approximated using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation">Clausius-Clapeyron equation</a>:</p> \[\ln\left(\frac{P}{P_0}\right) = -\frac{\Delta H}{R}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_0}\right)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(P\): The vapor pressure of the liquid at the temperature of interest (in Pascals, Pa). This is what we want to find to determine the boiling point.</li> <li>\(P_0\): The vapor pressure at a known reference temperature (also in Pascals). For water, we often use standard atmospheric pressure (101325 Pa) and its corresponding boiling point of 100°C (373.15 Kelvin).</li> <li>\(\Delta H\): The enthalpy of vaporization (in Joules per mole, J/mol). This represents the energy needed to change one mole of liquid into vapor at a constant temperature. For water, \(\Delta H\) is approximately 40,700 J/mol.</li> <li>\(R\): The ideal gas constant (8.314 J/mol·K). This constant relates energy to temperature for gases.</li> <li>\(T\): The temperature in Kelvin (K) at which we want to find the vapor pressure (and ultimately, the boiling point).</li> <li>\(T_0\): The reference temperature in Kelvin (K). Again, for water, this is often 373.15 K.</li> </ul> <h2 id="birmingham-vs-boulder-a-tale-of-two-cities">Birmingham vs. Boulder: A Tale of Two Cities</h2> <p>Birmingham, UK, sits at a relatively low altitude (around 140 meters above sea level). Water here boils pretty close to 100°C. Boulder, Colorado, on the other hand, is nestled in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains at an elevation of roughly 1655 meters. This significant difference in altitude has a significant impact on the temperature water boils at.</p> <p>To use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation we first need to calculate atmospheric pressure in Boulder - there are various ways of doing this (getting progressively more difficult) but here it is sufficient to assume a ‘standard atmosphere’ where temperature decreasesd with altitude, and assume that our coffee machine is being used indoors where the temperature is about 20°C, then we can use:</p> \[P = P_0\cdot\exp\left(\frac{-gM(h - h_0)}{RT}\right)\] <p>Where:</p> <ul> <li>\(P\): The air pressure (Pa) at altitude \(h\) (this is the thing we want)</li> <li>\(P_0\): Air pressure at reference altitude \(h_0\) (as in the previous equation we will use sea level pressure of 101325 Pa)</li> <li>\(g\): Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)</li> <li>\(M\): Molar mass of air (0.0289644 kg/mol)</li> <li>\(h\): Altitude (m) (Boulder is at 1,655m)</li> <li>\(h_0\): Reference altitude (m) (here we assume sea level, 0 m)</li> <li>\(R\): The universal gas constant (8.31432 J/(mol·K))</li> <li>\(T\): Temperature at altitude \(h\) (K) (must be in Kelvin, and so we use 293.15 K)</li> </ul> <p>Plugging those numbers in gives us:</p> \[\begin{eqnarray*} P &amp;=&amp; 101325\times\exp\left(\frac{-9.81\times 0.0289644\times (1655 - 0)}{8.31432\times 293.15}\right)\\ &amp;=&amp; 83546 \end{eqnarray*}\] <p>So the atmospheric pressure of Boulder is about 83500 Pa (you can also use this <a href="https://www.mide.com/air-pressure-at-altitude-calculator">online calculator</a> to be more accurate if you want to be, and this also provides more details on air pressure caclulations). Sub this value in (as \(P\)) into the Clausius-Clapeyroin equation and using our other reference values: \(P_0\) (101325 Pa), \(\Delta H\) (40700 J/mol), \(R\) (8.314 J/mol·K), and \(T_0\) (373.15 K) to get:</p> \[\ln\left(\frac{83500}{101325}\right) = -\left(\frac{40700}{8.314}\right)\times\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{373.15}\right)\] <p>Solving the above equation for \(T\) requires a little bit of algebraic manipulation but you should end up with \(T \approx 367.7 K\). Which (by removing 273.15) gives a value of 94.55°C for the boiling point of water for Boulder.</p> <p><strong>Water boils at approximately 94.5°C in Boulder.</strong></p> <h2 id="why-it-matters-for-coffee">Why It Matters for Coffee</h2> <p>Coffee brewing is a delicate dance of temperature and extraction. Water acts as a solvent, pulling flavorful compounds from the coffee grounds. The ideal brewing temperature for most coffee lies between 90-96°C. But brewing in Boulder presents a unique challenge. With water boiling at a lower temperature, you have a smaller window to extract those desirable flavors before under-extraction occurs. This can result in a sour or weak cup of coffee.</p> <p>My tips for brewing at higher altitudes (but I am by no means an expert!) are:</p> <ul> <li>Grind finer: A finer grind increases the surface area of the coffee, allowing for better extraction at lower temperatures.</li> <li>Pre-infusion: Bloom your grounds with a small amount of hot water before brewing. This helps saturate the coffee evenly.</li> <li>Extend brew time: Slightly longer brew times can help compensate for the lower temperature.</li> </ul>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="misc"/><category term="mathematics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why your coffee tastes different in Boulder, CO compared to Birmingham, UK.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">All England football league results</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/All_England_football_league_results/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="All England football league results"/><published>2024-12-28T10:09:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-28T10:09:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/All_England_football_league_results</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/All_England_football_league_results/"><![CDATA[<p>This article describes a plain text database of all England football (soccer) league results from 1888 to the present day (covering over 209,000 matches).</p> <p>You can access the latest database on its dedicated github page: <a href="https://github.com/seanelvidge/England-football-results/tree/main">England-football-results</a></p> <p>The database is updated roughly every two days (although I am looking for approaches to speed this up) for the top four tiers in England: Premier League, EFL Championship, EFL League One and EFL League Two.

However one that is often overlooked is the space-domain. The United States’ North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) not only continuously tracks 32,000 objects in space to avoid collisions, but also Santa’s global progress in delivering presents on Christmas Eve (https://www.noradsanta.org/en/). From NORAD’s tracks, we can see that he travels at 6.25 km/s (14,000 mph) over oceans (close to the speed of satellites in Low Earth Orbit at 7.7 km/s). However, he travels more slowly, at only 1.4 km/s (3,000 mph) while over the densely populated UK. His route perfectly optimised for reducing atmospheric drag.</p> <p>Whilst travelling over oceans he doesn’t need to be at low altitudes (no presents to deliver) so he takes advantage of the thinner atmosphere at higher altitudes. Also, delivering at night-time allows him to both avoid sleeping children and at the same time take advantage of the lower thermospheric densities, as the thermosphere cools and contracts while the Sun isn’t heating it. However, over populated areas, he travels more slowly in the lower, denser atmosphere, allowing more accurate present delivery while experiencing less heating due to the atmospheric drag.</p> <p>Another optimization Santa has made is in the design of his Sleigh and selection of Reindeer as the method of driving the Sleigh. In the atmospheric drag equation, there is a term known as the coefficient of drag, effectively how well something slips through the atmosphere. Smaller, pointier objects have lower coefficients of drag, think about arrows compared to parachutes. Reindeer have pointy snouts and present a relatively low cross-sectional area for their strength, allowing them to convert their power to speed. Meanwhile having nine reindeer in a 1-2-2-2-2 formation helps to efficiently cut into the air, and make it turbulent before the sleigh travels through, making it experience less drag, just like a cyclist in a peloton. However, Rudolph being at the front takes the brunt of this force due to atmospheric drag, with the majority of the kinetic energy turning into heat energy, leading to his red nose.</p> <p>Whilst we are not sure if Santa has yet upgraded his Sleigh to using the latest SANTA-NAV (GPS) technology, or whether he uses HF communications to keep in touch with the North Pole, we do know that on Christmas Eve, and throughout the Christmas period, the Space Environment research group at the University of Birmingham (SERENE) will be working with space weather centres around the world to help deliver 24/7 forecasting of the conditions in Earth’s upper atmosphere and its impacts on global position systems, HF communications, atmospheric drag and the need for satellite manoeuvres.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><category term="misc"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Santa is at the top of many engineering disciplines - his production line for presents, for example.

Modern players are scoring at unprecedented rates, and while this is undoubtedly exciting for fans, it raises an important question: Are today’s goal-scoring feats truly comparable to those of past legends?</p> <p>The landscape of international football has evolved significantly. The expansion of FIFA membership has introduced many new, smaller nations into the competitive arena. This influx has led to more matches where traditional football powerhouses face off against developing teams, often resulting in lopsided scorelines. Consequently, contemporary players have more opportunities to inflate their goal tallies against weaker opposition.</p> <p>This shift poses a challenge when attempting to compare the goal-scoring records of current players with those from previous eras. The legends of the past often played fewer matches against a more consistent level of competition, making their goal tallies a reflection of performances against relatively equal opponents.</p> <p>So, how can we level the playing field and make fair comparisons across different football eras?</p> <h2 id="introducing-a-weighted-goal-system">Introducing a Weighted Goal System</h2> <p>To address this disparity, I embarked on a project to adjust goal records by accounting for the relative strength of the opposition. The idea is to assign a weighting to each goal based on the difficulty of scoring against a particular team at the time of the match. This method aims to provide a more nuanced evaluation of a player’s goal-scoring achievements.</p> <h3 id="utilizing-elo-ratings">Utilizing Elo Ratings</h3> <p>The foundation of this approach lies in the Elo rating system, a method originally devised for ranking chess players but now widely adopted across various sports, including football. Elo ratings provide a dynamic measure of a team’s strength, updating after each match based on the result and the quality of the opposition.</p> <p>By leveraging historical Elo ratings, we can assess the relative strength of any two teams at the time they played. This allows us to calculate a weighting factor for each goal scored, reflecting the challenge posed by the opponent.</p> <h3 id="the-weighting-formula">The Weighting Formula</h3> <p>The weighting for each goal is determined using the following formula:</p> \[\text{Weight} = 1 - k\times\frac{E-O}{E}\] <p>Where, \(E\) is the Elo rating of England before the match, \(O\) is the Elo rating of the opposition before the match and \(k\) a scaling constant that adjusts the sensitivity of the weighting to the difference in Elo ratings.</p> <p>This formula adjusts the weight of a goal based on how much stronger or weaker the opposition is relative to England:</p> <ul> <li>If England faces a stronger team (\(O &gt; E\)), the weighting increases above 1, acknowledging the greater difficulty.</li> <li>If England faces a weaker team (\(O &lt; E\)), the weighting decreases below 1, reflecting the relatively easier challenge.</li> <li>The constant \(k\) controls how much the difference in ratings affects the weighting.</li> </ul> <h3 id="interpreting-the-weighting">Interpreting the Weighting</h3> <p>Adjusting the \(k\) value alters the impact of the opposition’s strength:</p> <ul> <li>A higher \(k\) value (e.g., 2) amplifies the effect, giving more weight to goals against stronger teams and less to those against weaker ones.</li> <li>A lower \(k\) value (e.g., 1) minimizes the effect, resulting in a more uniform weighting across different opponents.</li> </ul> <p>By experimenting with different \(k\) values, we can fine-tune the system to balance fairness and sensitivity, ensuring that exceptional performances against top-tier teams are appropriately recognized while maintaining a reasonable value for consistent scoring against all opponents.</p> <p>For the rest of this post we use a value of \(k=2\).</p> <h3 id="results">Results</h3> <p>When I last wrote a post similar to this, Wayne Rooney had just <a href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2015/Rooney-50/">broke the England National team goal record with 50 goals</a>. Since then Kane has broke this record again (at the time of writing) with 69 goals. Using the above approach the updated top 10 of England goal scorers are (the “Ranking” is based on the weighted goals column):</p> <style>table{border-collapse:collapse;width:50%;margin:20px auto}th,td{border:1px solid black;padding:8px;text-align:left}th{cursor:pointer;background-color:#f4f4f4}</style> <table id="footballTable"> <thead> <tr> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 0)">Ranking</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 1)">Name</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 2)">Goals</th> <th onclick="sortTable('footballTable', 3)">Weighted Goals</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Harry Kane</td> <td>69</td> <td>45</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Gary Lineker</td> <td>48</td> <td>37</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Bobby Charlton</td> <td>49</td> <td>36</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Jimmy Greaves</td> <td>44</td> <td>35</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Wayne Rooney</td> <td>53</td> <td>34</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Michael Owen</td> <td>40</td> <td>30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Alan Shearer</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Tom Finney</td> <td>30</td> <td>23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Nat Lofthouse</td> <td>30</td> <td>22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Frank Lampard</td> <td>29</td> <td>21</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <script>function sortTable(e,s){const t=document.getElementById(e),r=Array.from(t.rows).slice(1),n=!isNaN(r[0].cells[s].innerText);let o=r.sort((e,t)=>(n?+e.cells[s].innerText:e.cells[s].innerText.toLowerCase())>(n?+t.cells[s].innerText:t.cells[s].innerText.toLowerCase())?1:-1);const c="asc"===t.dataset.sortOrder?"desc":"asc";"desc"===c&&o.reverse(),t.dataset.sortOrder=c,o.forEach(e=>t.tBodies[0].appendChild(e))}</script> <p>You can see that whilst Kane is still number 1 - his number of goals are significantly less.

Gary Lineker moves from 4th in the all time list to 2nd.</p> <p>At the other end of the table we end up with a number of people (41) who (because of the rounding as well) move from having scored at

xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/Solar_storms_are_like_buses/"><![CDATA[<p>This was the second time this year they have been broadly visible across the UK, with the last major display occurring on the evening of May 10th, 2024. For many, seeing these incredible lights twice in a single year is almost unheard of, and for good reason: before 2024, the UK hadn’t experienced a space weather event of these magnitudes, in over two decades.</p> <p>What has caused this sudden surge in activity? The answer lies in the Sun’s solar cycle, which is rapidly approaching the peak of its activity, and, just like waiting for a bus, after 20 years of relative calm, the UK has now seen two major solar storms in the space of six months.</p> <h2 id="solar-maximum-the-driver-behind-the-lights">Solar Maximum: The Driver Behind the Lights</h2> <p>At the heart of this increased auroral activity is the Sun itself. The Sun goes through cycles of roughly 11 years, moving from periods of quiet (solar minimum) to periods of high activity (solar maximum). We’re currently approaching solar maximum, and this is why we’re seeing more frequent and powerful solar storms.</p> <p>These storms occur when the Sun releases huge quantities matter and magnetic field in the form of a coronal mass ejection (CME) which are also very often associated with solar flares. When these high-speed and high-energy CMEs reach Earth, they can interact and disturb our planet’s magnetic field, causing the stunning lights of the aurora. During solar maximum, the Sun produces more of these storms, leading to auroras that are brighter, more widespread, and visible at lower latitudes—like the UK.</p> <h2 id="what-makes-these-storms-so-special">What Makes These Storms So Special?</h2> <p>Solar storms are typically classified according to the NOAA Space Weather Scale which, for geomagnetic storms, run from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme), whilst the storm back in May was classified as a G5 (extreme) storm last night the storm peaked at a G4 (severe) event. For context, the last time the UK saw storms of this ‘size’ was over 20 years ago, in October 2003.</p> <p>What makes these storms particularly fascinating is that they push the auroral oval, the region around the poles where the Northern Lights occur, further south. Normally, the UK is too far from the poles to regularly see auroras, but during a G4 or G5 storm, the lights can be visible much further south than the usually are.</p> <h2 id="the-smartphone-effect">The Smartphone Effect</h2> <p>However this was still a relatively mild storm, and can be expected to occur on average about once every 3 or 4 years. One thing that has been particularly different this time around (for both last night and the storm in May), however, is the number of pictures flooding social media. Thanks to the widespread use of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras, capturing the aurora has never been easier. Modern smartphones now have the ability to take long-exposure shots, which allows them to capture the faint light of the aurora in ways the naked eye cannot. As a result, these natural light shows are being documented and shared like never before, over the coming months and year it may make it feel as if the auroras are more frequent than they might have seemed during previous solar cycles.</p> <h2 id="serene-understanding-space-weather">SERENE: Understanding Space Weather</h2> <p>While the visual spectacle of an aurora is captivating, there’s serious science behind these storms. The Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) group at the University of Birmingham is at the forefront of research into space weather and its effects on Earth. As a world-class research team, SERENE focuses on understanding the impacts of solar storms and helping society prepare for the disruptions they can cause.</p> <p>Space weather doesn’t just create auroras; it can also affect critical systems such as communications, GPS, satellite orbits and even the power grid. SERENE’s work is vital for mitigating the risks posed by these powerful geomagnetic storms. Their research is ensuring that as we enjoy the beauty of the Northern Lights, we’re also better equipped to protect the technology that supports modern life.</p> <h2 id="looking-ahead-more-auroras-to-come">Looking Ahead: More Auroras to Come?</h2> <p>As we approach the peak of the solar cycle, we can expect more opportunities to witness auroras in the UK. Solar storms will continue to erupt from the Sun and head toward Earth, and if the conditions are right (including cloud-free skies!), we could see even more stunning displays over the next couple of years. For those eager to catch the lights, staying tuned to space weather forecasts during this period of increased activity is key.</p> <p>The next time you see those vibrant reds and greens shimmering in the night sky, you’ll know that it’s not just a stroke of luck - it’s the Sun, cycling through its periodic bursts of activity. And thanks to research groups like SERENE, we can enjoy the beauty of the aurora with the peace of mind that we’re ready for whatever space weather may bring.</p> <p>Originally available from: <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2024/solar-storms-are-like-buses-you-wait-20-years-for-one-and-then-two-come-at-once" target="\_blank">https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/news/2024/solar-storms-are-like-buses-you-wait-20-years-for-one-and-then-two-come-at-once</a></p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="spaceWeather"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This week, across much of the world including the UK, the majestic aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, were once again visible to us.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The M69 Derby</title><link href="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/The_M69_Derby/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The M69 Derby"/><published>2024-09-21T06:44:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-09-21T06:44:00+00:00</updated><id>https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/The_M69_Derby</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://seanelvidge.github.io/articles/2024/The_M69_Derby/"><![CDATA[<p>This weekend I watched Coventry City FC vs Leicester City FC in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M69_derby" target="\_blank">“M69” derby (formerly the “A46” derby)</a>. It was a great game, but I’ve always found the name a bit odd, but then it isn’t the only football match referred to by a road name, but there seems to be no consistent reason why we do or do not.</p> <p>Since the naming of these derbys is essentially arbitrary I’ve decided that a match between two teams is the “something” derby if more than half the journey (by road) between the two teams’ stadia is on one road.</p> <p>For all English Premier League, Championship, League 1, League 2 and Scottish Premier League teams that results in the following matrix of derby names</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/derbydata-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/derbydata-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/derbydata-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/derbydata.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Which gives rise to a lot of potential derby’s, most of which would be called the “M1” or “M6” derby. To narrow it down, only unique road matches will be called derby’s (e.g. the only appearance of the M69 in the table is between Cov and Leicester; green in the previous image).</p> <ul> <li>The A19 Derby: Newcastle United v Middlesbrough</li> <li>The A23 Derby: Brighton &amp; Hove Albion v Crawley Town</li> <li>The A4040 Derby: Aston Villa v West Bromwich Albion</li> <li>The A59 Derby: Harrogate Town v Accrington Stanley</li> <li>The A6010 Derby: Manchester City v Salford City</li> <li>The A630 Derby: Sheffield United v Rotherham United</li> <li>The A66 Derby: Middlesbrough v Carlisle United</li> <li>The M23 Derby: Crystal Palace v Crawley Town</li> <li>The M27 Derby: Southampton v Portsmouth</li> <li>The M55 Derby: Blackpool v Preston North End</li> <li>The M69 Derby: Coventry City v Leicester City</li> </ul> <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tees%E2%80%93Wear_derby">Tees–Wear derby</a> between Middlesbrough and Sunderland has been called the A19 derby, but our research shows it would be better for Newcastle v Middlesborough.
