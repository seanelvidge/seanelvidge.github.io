It is pretty easy to tell what the UK has been upto during the coronavirus lockdown, virtual pub quizzes!

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <figure>
            {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/covid_quiz.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

Obviously the scale of the two units, Google search hits (as a fraction of the most hits) and COVID-19 are very different. So I’ve taken a simple [Z-transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-transform){:target="\_blank"} to plot the data on the same scale. I’ve also taken the rolling 7-day average to see the overall trend.

Clearly the most popular day to prepare your quiz is a Saturday!
