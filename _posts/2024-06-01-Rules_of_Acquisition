I am a big Star Trek fan and also have been enjoying the recent explosion of [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model){:target="\_blank"}, so I thought I would come up with a way they could be combined.

The 'Rules of Acquisition' are a collection of sayings of which the [Ferengi](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi){:target="\_blank"} society was based:

> Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by these rules to ensure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned.
> (DS9: "The Maquis, Part I") 

According to various sources, by the mid-22nd century there were 173 rules ([ENT: "Acquisition"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Acquisition_(episode)){:target="\_blank"}), by the 2370s there were 285 ([DS9: "Rules of Acquisition"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition_(episode)){:target="\_blank"}, ["Body Parts"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Parts_(episode)){:target="\_blank"}; [VOY: "False Profits"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/False_Profits_(episode)){:target="\_blank"}), and 289 by the 2380s ([LD: "Old Friends, New Planets"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Friends,_New_Planets_(episode)){:target="\_blank"}). 

These rules do not appear in a coherent order throughout the Star Trek canon, but are scattered throughout a number of episodes (predominatly in [Star Trek Deep Space 9](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine){:target="\_blank"}). Two excellent wikis exist to document the vast Star Trek universe, [Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Main){:target="\_blank"} (using information from all released television series and feature films) and [Memory Beta](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page){:target="\_blank"} (using information from all TV, films and licensed Star Trek works, including novels, comic books, RPG sourcebooks, video games and any other licensed works).
