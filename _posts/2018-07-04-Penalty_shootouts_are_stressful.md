It is fair to say that during Englandâ€™s (fantastic) World Cup win over Colombia [last night](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44610244){:target="\_blank"} I had my "heart in my mouth". It was rather nerve-racking!

Fortunately I was wearing my Fitbit and was able to download the timestamped data.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <figure>
            {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/football_HR.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

The celebration when Dier scored was epic.
