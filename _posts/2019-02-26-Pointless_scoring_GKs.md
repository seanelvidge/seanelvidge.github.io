The TV show "[Pointless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointless){:target="\_blank"}" is based around correctly guessing obscure answers to questions. Season 5, Episode 48 had a question about England goalkeepers.

Specifically the question was:

> We gave 100 people 100 seconds to name as many goalkeepers who have played for England men’s team as they could.
> (anyone who’s played in goal for England between 1966 and 2011 – no unused substitutes)

Well this falls right into an area of something I am interested in, quizzes and football! The strategy seems obvious, the more caps a goalie received likely the more well known he would be and the more points you would score. So we want to find a player with as few caps as possible.

Obviously I wanted to check the hypothesis.

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <figure>
            {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/Pointless_titles.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

The theory holds – the fewer caps, the better the score in Pointless.

There are two interesting players to mention. Robert Green – who for relatively few caps scores highly ([it's not hard to guess why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AWLpjhwu0c){:target="\_blank"}) and [Ron Springett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Springett){:target="\_blank"} who played 33 games for England, and was even part of the 1966 World Cup winning squad, but seems fairly unknown.
