Could Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) from the motion picture ‘Titanic’ both have survived by both floating on the door? (Clearly there are a load of spoilers in this article – but the film did come out over 20 years ago so I'm [not going to worry](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=film+spoilers+statute+of+limitations){:target="\_blank"} too much about it).

[Note: This is a copy of an article I wrote in 2011, which is no longer available online so I’ve repeated it here for prosperity]

## Introduction

During the [1997 motion picture 'Titanic'](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120338/) by James Cameron there is a famous scene involving the two main characters, Jack Dawson (as played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) towards the end of the film. The scene involves Jack in the ocean and Rose floating on a wooden object, Jack dies and Rose survives, however the question we ask is, need Jack of died? Was there room (and spare buoyancy) for two? This is a question which appears repeatedly (e.g. [[1]](#1) and [[2]](#2)) on the internet but with varying answers, but hopefully this article can draw a conclusion to the discussion.

The first point to settle is that Rose is not floating on a door and is instead floating on a piece of wood panelling. The panelling in the film is based upon a recovered piece, homed at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, in Halifax, Nova Scotia [3].
