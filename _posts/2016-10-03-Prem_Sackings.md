I’ll get straight to the point, on average the first Premier League manager is sacked after 77 days.

Following the sacking of Francesco Guidolin from Swansea City today (52 days into the season), I wondered how long into the season the first manager is sacked on average. I’m counting the total number of days from the first match of the season to the first sacking (and I mean sacking, I’ve excluded managers leaving by mutual consent, or moving to a different job).

The plot is below. Moral of the story is: mean is 77 days and the standard deviation is 47 days.
