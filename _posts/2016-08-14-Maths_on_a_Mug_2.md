This is a classic [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner){:target="\_blank"} puzzle. One solution is:

<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        <figure>
            {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/mathsonamug/mathsonamug_2_sol.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

Construct the additional squares indicated by dotted lines. Angle C is the same as the sum of angles A and D, since they are both made by cutting a square in half along the diagonal. Angle B equals angle D because they are corresponding angles of similar right triangles (made by cutting a rectangle made from two squares in half along the diagonal). That means B can be substituted for D, which automatically makes the C equals the sum of A and B.
