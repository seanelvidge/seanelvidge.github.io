After a spring clean I came across a talk I gave on the classification of complex reflection groups back in March 2011. Nostalgia set in and I started to read through my notes. Whilst it only deals with the imprimitive complex reflection groups it seemed like a decent summary of the theory. So I thought I would digitise it and leave it [here](/assets/files/complex_reflection_group_slides.pdf) in case anyone ever found it useful.

        </a>
    </div>

If you want to read (a lot) more about Complex Reflection Groups my undergraduate masters dissertation is available [here](/assets/files/complex_reflection_group_Project.pdf).
