For many, seeing these incredible lights twice in a single year is almost unheard of, and for good reason: before 2024, the UK hadn’t experienced a space weather event of these magnitudes, in over two decades.</p> <p>What has caused this sudden surge in activity? The answer lies in the Sun’s solar cycle, which is rapidly approaching the peak of its activity, and, just like waiting for a bus, after 20 years of relative calm, the UK has now seen two major solar storms in the space of six months.</p> <h2 id="solar-maximum-the-driver-behind-the-lights">Solar Maximum: The Driver Behind the Lights</h2> <p>At the heart of this increased auroral activity is the Sun itself. The Sun goes through cycles of roughly 11 years, moving from periods of quiet (solar minimum) to periods of high activity (solar maximum). We’re currently approaching solar maximum, and this is why we’re seeing more frequent and powerful solar storms.</p> <p>These storms occur when the Sun releases huge quantities matter and magnetic field in the form of a coronal mass ejection (CME) which are also very often associated with solar flares. When these high-speed and high-energy CMEs reach Earth, they can interact and disturb our planet’s magnetic field, causing the stunning lights of the aurora. During solar maximum, the Sun produces more of these storms, leading to auroras that are brighter, more widespread, and visible at lower latitudes—like the UK.</p> <h2 id="what-makes-these-storms-so-special">What Makes These Storms So Special?</h2> <p>Solar storms are typically classified according to the NOAA Space Weather Scale which, for geomagnetic storms, run from G1 (minor) to G5 (extreme), whilst the storm back in May was classified as a G5 (extreme) storm last night the storm peaked at a G4 (severe) event. For context, the last time the UK saw storms of this ‘size’ was over 20 years ago, in October 2003.</p> <p>What makes these storms particularly fascinating is that they push the auroral oval, the region around the poles where the Northern Lights occur, further south. Normally, the UK is too far from the poles to regularly see auroras, but during a G4 or G5 storm, the lights can be visible much further south than the usually are.</p> <h2 id="the-smartphone-effect">The Smartphone Effect</h2> <p>However this was still a relatively mild storm, and can be expected to occur on average about once every 3 or 4 years. One thing that has been particularly different this time around (for both last night and the storm in May), however, is the number of pictures flooding social media. Thanks to the widespread use of smartphones equipped with high-quality cameras, capturing the aurora has never been easier. Modern smartphones now have the ability to take long-exposure shots, which allows them to capture the faint light of the aurora in ways the naked eye cannot. As a result, these natural light shows are being documented and shared like never before, over the coming months and year it may make it feel as if the auroras are more frequent than they might have seemed during previous solar cycles.</p> <h2 id="serene-understanding-space-weather">SERENE: Understanding Space Weather</h2> <p>While the visual spectacle of an aurora is captivating, there’s serious science behind these storms. The Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) group at the University of Birmingham is at the forefront of research into space weather and its effects on Earth. As a world-class research team, SERENE focuses on understanding the impacts of solar storms and helping society prepare for the disruptions they can cause.</p> <p>Space weather doesn’t just create auroras; it can also affect critical systems such as communications, GPS, satellite orbits and even the power grid. SERENE’s work is vital for mitigating the risks posed by these powerful geomagnetic storms. Their research is ensuring that as we enjoy the beauty of the Northern Lights, we’re also better equipped to protect the technology that supports modern life.</p> <blockquote> <p>Thanks to research groups like SERENE, we can enjoy the beauty of the aurora with the peace of mind that we’re ready for whatever space weather may bring. Prof. Sean Elvidge, Professor in Space Environment, in the Space Environment and Radio Engineering (SERENE) group</p> </blockquote> <h2 id="looking-ahead-more-auroras-to-come">Looking Ahead: More Auroras to Come?</h2> <p>As we approach the peak of the solar cycle, we can expect more opportunities to witness auroras in the UK. Solar storms will continue to erupt from the Sun and head toward Earth, and if the conditions are right (including cloud-free skies!), we could see even more stunning displays over the next couple of years. For those eager to catch the lights, staying tuned to space weather forecasts during this period of increased activity is key.</p> <p>The next time you see those vibrant reds and greens shimmering in the night sky, you’ll know that it’s not just a stroke of luck - it’s the Sun, cycling through its periodic bursts of activity. And thanks to research groups like SERENE, we can enjoy the beauty of the aurora with the peace of mind that we’re ready for whatever space weather may bring.</p> </body></html>
