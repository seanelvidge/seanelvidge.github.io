Trek fan and also have been enjoying the recent explosion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Large Language Models (LLMs)</a>, so I thought I would come up with a way they could be combined.</p> <p>The ‘Rules of Acquisition’ are a collection of sayings of which the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Ferengi</a> society is based:</p> <blockquote> <p>Every Ferengi business transaction is governed by these rules to ensure a fair and honest deal for all parties concerned.<br> (DS9: “The Maquis, Part I”)</p> </blockquote> <p>According to various sources, by the mid-22nd century there were 173 rules (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Acquisition_(episode)" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">ENT: “Acquisition”</a>), by the 2370s there were 285 (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition_(episode)" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">DS9: “Rules of Acquisition”</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Body_Parts_(episode)" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">“Body Parts”</a>; <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/False_Profits_(episode)" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">VOY: “False Profits”</a>), and 289 by the 2380s (<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Old_Friends,_New_Planets_(episode)" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">LD: “Old Friends, New Planets”</a>).</p> <p>The exact rules appear fairly randomly throughout the Star Trek canon, scattered throughout a number of episodes (predominatly in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Star Trek Deep Space 9</a>). Two excellent wikis exist to document the vast Star Trek universe, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Main" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Memory Alpha</a> (using information from all released television series and feature films) and <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">Memory Beta</a> (using information from all TV, films and licensed Star Trek works, including novels, comic books, RPG sourcebooks, video games and any other licensed works).</p> <p>In the “primary” canon, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">52 of the 289 rules were defined</a> and in the extended canon <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi_Rules_of_Acquisition" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">144 of the 285 rules were defined</a> (although Rule #2 is defined twice, in different ways).</p> <p>In September 2024 OpenAI released their <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-o1-preview/" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">“o1-preview” model</a> which were “trained to spend more time thinking through problems before they respond, much like a person would. Through training, they learn to refine their thinking process, try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes”. It seems like a very powerful model so I decided to put it to the test…</p> <p>I feed it the complete biographical information of the Ferengi’s, their biology, psychology (greed and self preservation), societal information and culture (profit and loss, beliefs, rituals and diplomacy) which are well defined, and referenced <a href="https://memory-beta.fandom.com/wiki/Ferengi" target="\_blank" rel="external nofollow noopener">here</a>. Along with that I provided the 144 existing rules from the wider canon and asked it to fill in the missing rules.</p> <p>And what a wonderful job it did! The complete list is below, merging the ChatGPT-derived rules along with the existing canon (with those by ChatGPT clearly highlighted) but some of my favourites it came up with are:</p> <p>#12 “Anything worth doing is worth doing for profit.” #24: “Never mix business with pleasure unless it enhances profit.” #28: “Morality is always negotiable in the pursuit of profit.” #80: “If it works, sell it; if it doesn’t, sell it as an antique.” #96: “For every opportunity, there’s an equal and opposite opportunity—exploit both.” #114: “The small print holds the biggest profits.” #132: “A lie isn’t a lie until someone else knows the truth.” #161: “Never work for free, unless there’s future profit.”</p> <h2 id="complete-list-of-the-rules-of-acquisition">Complete List of the Rules of Acquisition</h2> <table border="1" class="dataframe"> <thead> <tr style="text-align: right;"> <th>Rule Number</th> <th>Rule</th> <th>Source</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>1</td> <td>Once you have their money... you never give it back.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Nagus", PRD episode: "First Con-tact"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>2</td> <td>Money is everything.</td> <td>ST - Strange New Worlds 9 short story: "The Last Tree on Ferenginar: A Ferengi Fable From the Future"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>3</td> <td>Never spend more for an acquisition than you have to.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Maquis, Part II"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>4</td> <td>Sedition and treason are always profitable.</td> <td>ST video game: Star Trek Online</td> </tr> <tr> <td>5</td> <td>Always exaggerate your estimates.</td> <td>SCE eBook: Cold Fusion</td> </tr> <tr> <td>6</td> <td>Never allow family law stand in the way of opportunity.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Nagus"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>7</td> <td>Keep your ears open.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "In the Hands of the Prophets"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>8</td> <td>Small print leads to large risk.</td> <td>DS9 reference: The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition</td> </tr> <tr> <td>9</td> <td>Opportunity plus instinct equals profit.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "The Storyteller"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>10</td> <td>Greed is eternal.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Prophet Motive"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>11</td> <td>Opportunity waits for no one—seize it quickly.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12</td> <td>Anything worth doing is worth doing for profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>13</td> <td>Anything worth doing is worth doing for money.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>14</td> <td>Sometimes the quickest way to find profits is to let them find you.</td> <td>Fortune of War (TTN novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>15</td> <td>Dead men close no deals.</td> <td>Demons of Air and Darkness (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>16</td> <td>A deal is a deal... until a better one comes along.</td> <td>The Ferengi Rules of Acquisition (DS9 reference book)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>17</td> <td>A contract is a contract is a contract... but only between Ferengi</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Body Parts"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>18</td> <td>A Ferengi without profit is no Ferengi at all.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Heart of Stone", DS9 - The Dog of War comic: "Issue 3"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>19</td> <td>Satisfaction is not guaranteed.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>20</td> <td>He who dives under the table today lives to profit tomorrow.</td> <td>Ferenginar: Satisfaction is Not Guaranteed (DS9 novella)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>21</td> <td>Never place friendship above profit.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Rules of Acquisition", PRD episode: "First Con-tact"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>22</td> <td>A wise man can hear profit in the wind.</td> <td>DS9 episode: "Rules of Acquisition"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>23</td> <td>Nothing is more important than your health... except for your money.</td> <td>ENT episode: "Acquisition"</td> </tr> <tr> <td>24</td> <td>Never mix business with pleasure unless it enhances profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>25</td> <td>There's no profit in altruism.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>26</td> <td>Customers are like latinum; treasure them and they'll return.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>27</td> <td>There's nothing more dangerous than an honest businessman.</td> <td>Legends of the Ferengi (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>28</td> <td>Morality is always negotiable in the pursuit of profit.</td> <td>ChatGPT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>29</td> <td>What's in it for me?</td> <td>Highest Score (DS9 novel)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>30</td> <td>"Confidentiality equals profit."</td> <td>DS9 - The Badlands novel: Part IV</td> </tr> <tr> <td>31</td> <td>Never make fun of a Ferengi's mother.
